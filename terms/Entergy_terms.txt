We reserve the right to take any action that we deem necessary to ensure the security of the Sites and as allowed by law and our Privacy Policy.</p>

You may control your user profile and how you interact with the Sites by changing the settings in the account maintenance sections of the Sites. You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your account and you agree you will not sell, transfer, license or assign your account, followers, username, or any account rights.

<h4>7. Alternate login methods</h4>
<p>You may be able to access your account within the Sites by using features such as fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, or other biometric input, which are specific to your mobile device. <strong>These features are provided through your mobile device’s built-in functionality, and Entergy has no responsibility for any failure of these features, either where such failure may prevent you from accessing your account or where such failure may permit an unauthorized third party to access your account. When you use these features, your biometric data is stored on your device and is not transferred to, processed, or stored by or on behalf of Entergy. Be aware that if you enable features such as fingerprint or facial recognition, anyone with a fingerprint or face profile stored on your device may have access to the information contained within the Sites.</strong></p>
<h4>8. Payments</h4>
<p>Certain features of the Sites may permit you to make payments related to your account. Generally, by accessing and using these features, you authorize Entergy to use any account or debit information provided by you through the sites to process payments which you initiate. If the information you provide is invalid, or your chosen payment method is not honored, Entergy may demand payment by alternate method, and you agree to pay the amount due. Entergy is not liable for any payment failure resulting from inaccurate or incomplete information that you provide, or from any error in any financial institution’s or other third-party’s systems. In addition, depending on the particular Sites or features, your access to or use of payment functionality may be subject to additional terms and conditions that are presented to you when you access or use these features. In the event of any conflict between these additional terms and conditions, as between you and Entergy, the additional terms and conditions will govern. If the payment functionality is provided by a third party, your use may be subject to terms and conditions provided by such third party in accordance with Section 10(d).</p>
<h4>9. Monitoring</h4>
<p>Entergy retains the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, at any time, and from time to time, to monitor, intercept, search, and record (for any permissible purpose under the Privacy Policy) any and all activities on Entergy’s systems, including the user’s use of the Sites, and undertaken through any computer, mobile device, or other device connected to the Entergy network. Entergy may disclose information, as it deems appropriate and subject to its Privacy Policy and applicable law, to third parties such as the local, state, or federal law enforcement, to help ensure information security, protect Entergy’s network, or cooperate in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. Except as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Entergy further reserves the right, in accordance with Entergy’s Privacy Policy and applicable law, without the consent of or liability to any user or third party, to record, screen, edit, curtail, or remove any content on this system, including the Services, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, including because it believes such content to be harmful, harassing, abusive, offensive, or in violation of these Site Terms. Entergy shall have no liability to any user or third party for the performance or non-performance of monitoring or other actions taken to protect the Entergy network, or pursuant to these Site Terms.</p>

</ol>
<h4>11. Unavailability of the sites; failure of online transactions</h4>
<p>The unavailability of the Sites, or the failure of any online transaction for any reason, shall not relieve any utility customer or user from, or excuse the delay in the payment or performance of, any obligation owed to Entergy for or in connection with utility services that have been rendered or otherwise. Certain features of the Sites may permit you to: (a) report an outage, or (b) view an outage map. Entergy makes these features available as a convenience to you and its other customers but does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy of outage maps accessed through the Sites, nor does it guarantee any particular response with respect to outages reported through the Sites.</p>
<h4>12. Availability of products or services</h4>

The Sites may provide certain summary descriptions or other helpful information regarding products and services. Any such materials are intended to generally describe the products and services and are subject in all respects to the specific terms and conditions of the actual product/service agreement to which they refer. Entergy does not warrant that product or service descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The listing, description of, or reference to, a product or service on the Sites does not imply that the product or service is presently available. All orders or purchases of products or services are subject to prevailing law, including, as appropriate, export and import regulations and boycotting restrictions, if any, imposed by governing bodies having jurisdiction over such orders, purchases, products or services.</p>
<h4>13. Limitations of liability</h4>
<p>IN NO EVENT WILL ENTERGY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES FOR ANY USE OF THE SITES OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA ON ENTERGY’S OR ANY USER’S COMPUTER HARDWARE OR INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEMS, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (A) ANY ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES REGARDING YOUR OR ANY OTHER PARTY'S USE OF THE SITES; (B) ANY ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERS; OR (C) WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OF GOD, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THE SITES, OR RELATED INFORMATION OR PROGRAMS, THAT ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH: (1) MISTAKES OR OMISSIONS IN, OR DELAYS IN TRANSMISSION OF, INFORMATION TO OR FROM THE USER; (2) INTERRUPTIONS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS TO THE SITES; OR (3) VIRUSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ENTERGY HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ENTERGY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TECHNICAL, HARDWARE, OR SOFTWARE FAILURES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND, OR FOR FAILED, INCOMPLETE, DISTORTED, OR DELAYED DATA TRANSMISSIONS, OR EQUIPMENT INCOMPATIBILITIES, IN RELATION TO ANY USE OF THE SITES. ENTERGY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM DESTRUCTIVE COMPUTER CODE SUCH AS VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, AND THE LIKE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ENTERGY BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OF INFORMATION, INTERACTIVE FORMS, CONTENT, OR COMPUTER CODE ON THE SITES OR ANY WEBSITE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SITES. </p>
<p>OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE USE OF THE SITES, IF ANY, AND IF YOU HAVE PAID NO AMOUNT, THEN FIFTY DOLLARS ($50).

Entergy reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which you are required to indemnify against, and you agree to cooperate in Entergy’s defense of such matter. This indemnification shall survive any termination of these Site Terms.</p>

<p>Entergy will not be deemed to have waived any of the terms of these Site Terms or any of its other terms, conditions, or policies with respect to the Sites, or any of its rights with respect to the foregoing, unless the waiver is in a written document expressly setting forth the nature and extent of the waiver, executed by a representative of Entergy duly authorized to execute and deliver the same. No delay or omission on the part of Entergy in enforcing its rights or remedies under these Site Terms or any such other terms, conditions, or policies shall impair its current or future exercise of its rights and remedies thereunder or be construed as a waiver of any provision of these Site Terms or any such other terms, conditions, or policies.

<p></p>

<p>The Sites and these Site Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas, excluding its conflicts of laws principles, and, where and to the extent applicable, by federal law. Terms, conditions, and policies applicable to the provision of particular online services related to utility customer accounts are governed by the laws of the state in which the relevant Entergy public utility affiliate provides utility services, regardless of where a particular user is located or resides at the time the user obtains utility services, accesses the Website, or makes use of the Web Services. To the extent of a conflict, the law of the state in which the relevant Entergy public utility affiliate provides utility services will govern. Entergy does not represent that the materials or Content available on its Sites may be used outside of the United States. Access to the Sites may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. Users who access Sites from outside the United States do so at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction from which the Sites are accessed.</p>

<h4>21. Severability</h4>
<p>If any provision of these Site Terms or of any other terms, conditions, or policies with respect to the Sites is determined to be void or invalid as a matter of law, the remaining provisions of these Site Terms and of any such other terms, conditions, and policies shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h4>22. App store terms of use</h4>
<p>The following terms apply to any Application accessed through or downloaded from any app store or distribution platform (like an Entergy portal, the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the Application may now or in the future be made available (each an “Application Provider”). You acknowledge and agree that: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>These Terms are concluded between you and Entergy, and not with the Application Provider, and that Entergy (not the Application Provider, to the extent the Application provider is not Entergy), is solely responsible for the Application.</li>
<li>To the extent you obtain an Application from the Apple Application Store, any licenses granted hereunder for the use of the Application are limited to a license to use the Application on any Apple-branded Products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Application Store Terms of Service, except that the Application may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via family sharing or volume purchasing.</li>
<li>Unless expressly stated otherwise in writing by the Application Provider, the Application Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application.</li>
<li>To the extent the Application Provider is not Entergy, you may notify the Application Provider in the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, and the Application Provider will refund the purchase price for the Application to you (if applicable) and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Application Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application. To the extent that Entergy is not the Application Provider, any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses other than the purchase price attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Entergy in accordance with these Terms.</li>
<li>To the extent the Application Provider is not Entergy, the Application Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the Application or your possession and use of the Application, including, but not limited to: (A) product liability claims; (B) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (C) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</li>
<li>To the extent the Application Provider is not Entergy, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of that Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Entergy will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.</li>
<li>To the extent the Application Provider is not Entergy, the Application Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, the Application Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the Application against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</li>
<li>You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the Application.</li>
<li>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</li>
<li>To the extent you obtain an Application from the Apple Application Store, you agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of the sections of these Terms applicable to the Application, and that, upon the your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the applicable End User License Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</li>
