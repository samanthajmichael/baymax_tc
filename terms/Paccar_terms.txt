<p><strong>1.   SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Eligibility for Use of the Services.</strong> You must be at least eighteen (18) years old, or the age of majority as determined by the laws of your state of residency, to assume the obligations set forth in this Agreement. You are solely responsible for the transmission of data from your Vehicle and the use of the Services in your Vehicle, even if you are not the one using it or claim the use was not authorized. You are also solely responsible for any Subscription requested by you, or used by anyone using your Vehicle. IF YOU OR ANYONE USING YOUR VEHICLE DISABLES DATA TRANSMISSION FROM YOUR VEHICLE, ALL TRUCK CONNECTIVITY SERVICES WILL ALSO BE DISABLED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System Requirements and Service Providers.</strong> To utilize the Services or a Subscription and/or transmit data, your Vehicle must have installed an authorized Truck Connectivity Services system (the “System” or “telecommunication device”), which is the equipment, including hardware and software, used to provide the Services to your Vehicle. PACCAR may interact with and/or engage one or more third-party providers as necessary to provide the Services. Those third-party providers include any person, company, or entity who provides any service, content, technology, equipment, or facilities in connection with the Services or the System, including, but not limited to, wireless network service providers, suppliers, licensors, manufacturers, distributors, and authorized PACCAR dealers. The third-party providers are referred to in this Agreement as “<strong>Service Providers</strong>”. You are responsible for paying directly to all Service Providers any charges for services furnished by them that are not expressly covered by your Truck Connectivity Subscription or your Vehicle’s regular or extended warranty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.    SUBSCRIPTION ACTIVATION AND CANCELLATION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activation. </strong>Services are operational prior to the purchase or lease of the Vehicle, this includes all telematics and vehicle status data collection and vehicle location services. <strong>Vehicle data, including the Vehicle’s location, engine data and fault data, may be collected and used by these features.</strong> The Services may remain active subsequent to the purchase or lease of the Vehicle.  To deactivate the Services, opt out as described above.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription Period. </strong>A Vehicle Purchase Subscription of Truck Connectivity Services (a “<strong>Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period</strong>”) was purchased at the time you purchased your Vehicle. The Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period starts as of the date and time the truck and engine warranty are registered. Please see your dealer for information regarding eligibility and duration of your Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period. TO ACTIVATE AND UTILIZE YOUR VEHICLE PURCHASE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU MUST ACTIVATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT PACCARSOLUTIONS.COM AND ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW. After the Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period expires, you must purchase a Subscription, and place a valid form of payment on file with us to continue utilizing the Subscription (the “<strong>Paid Subscription Period</strong>” and together with the Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period, the “Subscription”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Renewal: Once you have entered a Paid Subscription Period, your Subscription will automatically renew under this Agreement. You hereby consent and expressly agree to such automatic renewals unless you cancel as provided under this Agreement. Your form of payment on file will automatically be charged at the subscription rate in effect at the time of renewal plus taxes and other charges unless your Subscription is cancelled as allowed by this Agreement.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Right to Cancel. To cancel your Subscription, you must call the dealership where you purchased your vehicle or cancel online at PACCARSolutions.com. To cancel all Services, you must opt out of all connectivity as described above.</strong></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Fees and Billing</strong>. During the Vehicle Purchase Subscription Period, there are no additional charges for the Subscription, payment is made at the time of purchasing the vehicle.  During the Paid Subscription Period, to utilize the Subscription, you must have a valid form of payment on file with us. As noted above, Paid Subscription Service periods will auto-renew and we will charge your form of payment for the initial Subscription fee associated with renewal interval you select, and each renewal thereafter. By providing payment account information to us, you represent that you are an authorized user of such payment account.</p>
<p>If the payment method you have provided us fails to enable payment for any reason at the time of renewal, you authorize us to make a second attempt no less than 120 hours after the first attempt. If we are unable to successfully process a payment on the second attempt, then your auto-renewal election will be deleted, your VIN will be unsubscribed, and your Subscription will expire on the anniversary date of your Subscription. If you subsequently desire to restore your Subscription you will need go to the online portal to enroll again by selecting the VIN for the vehicle, going to details, and selecting Subscribe.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Payment Obligations.</strong> Payment must be made in U.S. Dollars and is due in advance. If your credit or bank card provider refuses a charge or an automated withdrawal, we can terminate or suspend your Subscription and your Services. If you object to any fees or charges for a Subscription billed by or through us, you must tell us in writing at PACCARRemoteDiagnostics@paccar.com within 60 days after the fee or charge is incurred (unless prohibited by applicable law, in which case as minimally modified to comply with applicable law), otherwise you accept any such fees and charges as-is, and YOU WAIVE ANY DISPUTE RELATING THERETO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxes and Other Fees.</strong> You promise to pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by the government and charged to you by us. We may not tell you in advance of changes to these items. The taxes, fee and surcharges will be added to the cost of your Subscription. For some Subscriptions, we may charge additional fees related to our costs (or the costs of our wireless Service Providers) to comply with government regulations which may change from time to time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refunds.</strong> Should we issue a refund to you, we may apply the refund to the valid form of payment on your account that was used to purchase the Subscription. Alternatively, we may issue a check and mail it to the address you have provided to us on your account. There will be no prorated refund if you are paying for your Subscription on a month-to-month basis. Your Subscription will continue until the end of the month in which you cancelled, and then the Subscription will terminate.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>4.    TRANSFERRING, REACTIVATING OR CHANGING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.</strong> The Subscription is transferable to another Vehicle or another person or entity. If you terminate your ownership interest in the Vehicle, you must contact your dealership to deactivate or transfer the Subscription. If you continue using a Subscription for other vehicles, you must locate the VIN of the transferred vehicle in your account and select “remove vehicle from account.”  You must also direct the purchaser/transferee of the vehicle to these terms and conditions.  You may cancel, change, or reactivate your Subscription as allowed under this Agreement. However, any such request must be made by you or an authorized user of legal age listed on your account (or from someone we believe is your authorized agent). If we do any of these things, you agree to pay any charges associated with these requests.</p>

This includes changing the terms of this Agreement, the Services, or the prices of Subscriptions. We will provide advance notice to you at the email address we have on file for your account (subject to a later effective date as required by law) if any such change materially affects your rights under this Agreement, or negatively impacts your Subscription or Services in a material way, or results in higher Subscription fees charged to you.

<p><strong>7.    SERVICE AND SYSTEM LIMITATIONS.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Availability.</strong> Truck Connectivity Services are available in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Services work using wireless communication networks and the Global Positioning System ("<strong>GPS</strong>") satellite network. NOT ALL TRUCK CONNECTIVITY SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE, PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE OR ENCLOSED AREAS, OR ON ALL VEHICLES, AT ALL TIMES. The area in which you are driving may affect the availability of the Services. Additionally, the Services are not available if the GPS system is not working. The Services will not function unless you are in a location where the wireless Service Provider has coverage, network capacity, and reception when the service is requested or delivered. Certain programming limitations of the GPS system and obstructed signals may impair our ability to determine your Vehicle’s precise location. There are other factors we cannot control that may prevent us from providing the Services to you or that may impair the quality of the Services. Some examples are hills, tall buildings, tunnels, weather, electrical system design and architecture of your Vehicle, damage to important parts of your Vehicle in an accident, or wireless phone network congestion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vehicle and Equipment.</strong> The Truck Connectivity System is an embedded telematics device installed in your Vehicle at the factory which receives GPS signals and communicates with the response center via wireless communications networks. The System is not intended to place or receive calls. YOUR VEHICLE HAS TO HAVE A WORKING ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (INCLUDING ADEQUATE BATTERY POWER) FOR THE TRUCK CONNECTIVITY SYSTEM TO OPERATE. The Services may not work if your Truck Connectivity System is tampered with or changed by someone we have not authorized, or if you haven't maintained it and your Vehicle in good working order and in compliance with all government regulations. If you try to add or modify any equipment or software in your Vehicle, including the Truck Connectivity System, the Services may not work and we can terminate your Subscription and your Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acts Outside of Our Control.</strong> We are not responsible for any delay or failure in performance if such failure or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions. NEITHER PACCAR NOR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OR DELAY IN PERFORMING UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY AN ACT OR OMISSION OF A THIRD-PARTY, OR BY ANY EQUIPMENT FAILURE, INCLUDING INTERNET, COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATION, OR OTHER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, ACT OF GOD, NATURAL DISASTER, STRIKES, TERRORISM, CIVIL DISTURBANCES, LABOR SHORTAGES, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, EQUIPMENT OR FACILITY SHORTAGE, OR OTHER CAUSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL OR THE CONTROL OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS.</p>

<p>1.    ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US WILL BE DECIDED BY ARBITRATION AND NOT IN COURT OR BY JURY TRIAL.</p>
<p>2.    IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.</p>
<p>3.    DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>If you and we have a disagreement related to the Services, <strong>we will try to resolve it by talking with each other</strong>. If we fail resolve it that way, then we and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims</strong> between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (iii) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iv) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to “us” and “we” in this Section 15 include the Third-party Beneficiaries, and references to "you," “we” and "us" in this section 15 include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Services or the System under this or prior agreements between you and us. If federal law provides that a claim or dispute is not subject to binding arbitration, this arbitration clause shall not apply to such claim or dispute. ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE IS TO BE ARBITRATED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION. YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO ARBITRATE AS A CLASS ACTION. Disputes will be adjudicated under the applicable commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association (800-778-7879 or www.adr.org). You may get a copy of the rules by visiting the AAA website.</p>
<p>Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules. The arbitrator shall apply governing substantive law and the applicable statutes of limitation. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the arbitration hearing shall be conducted in the federal district in which you live. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law. If the chosen arbitration organization’s rules conflict with this clause, then the provisions of this clause shall control. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except that either party may appeal any arbitrator’s award pursuant to the rules of the arbitration organization. Any arbitration under this arbitration clause shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1 et. seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement (i) is not a contract under which any person is authorized to purchase any vehicle from PACCAR for resale to any other person, or to repair or service any vehicle offered by PACCAR; (ii) is therefore not a "motor vehicle franchise contract" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. §1226; (iii) is not subject to or governed by the provisions of 15 U.S.C. §1226; (iv) is not subject to or governed by the Act or any other state or federal dealer franchise law; and (v) is subject fully to the provisions of the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.</p>
<p>You retain the right to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court’s jurisdiction. You and we retain any rights to self-help remedies. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator’s award. This arbitration clause shall survive any termination of this contract. If any part of this arbitration Clause, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable. If a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class allegations have been made, the remainder of this Arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). The Notice to PACCAR should be addressed to: Legal Department, PACCAR Inc, P.O. Box 1518 Bellevue, WA 98009. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>B. Governing Law.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except as provided otherwise in Section 15A above, this Agreement and any disputes arising out of or relating to it will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law principles, and by any applicable tariffs, wherever filed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>C. Time Limits.</strong> YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COMMENCE ANY CLAIM AGAINST PACCAR, OR ANY THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY LATER THAN ONE YEAR, AFTER THE CLAIM ARISES, OR THE SHORTEST DURATION OF TIME PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW IF GREATER THAN ONE YEAR.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Our Relationship.</strong> Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the parties or any third party beneficiary. Neither party, by virtue of this Agreement, will have any right, power, or authority to act or create an obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment.</strong> We can assign this Agreement or your obligations to pay under it in whole or in part to anyone we choose. You cannot assign this Agreement or your obligations to anyone else without our prior written consent. Any assignment by you without such consent shall be null and void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Provisions.</strong> This Agreement (including these terms and conditions, the PACCAR Privacy Statement, the Warranty Agreement, and any other Truck Connectivity Services documents incorporated in them) is the entire agreement between you and us.  In the case of conflict between this agreement and the PACCAR Privacy Statement, the Privacy Statement will prevail. This Agreement supersedes all other agreements or representations, oral or written, between us, past or present. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon determination by a court or arbitrator that any term or provision herein is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such court or arbitrator shall modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of such provision as closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. If any part of this Agreement is considered invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, the rest of it will remain enforceable. Even after this Agreement has ended, its provisions will govern any disputes arising out of or relating to it (unless it's been replaced by a new agreement between us). It will also be binding on your heirs and successors and on our successors. No waiver of any part of this Agreement, or of any breach of it, in any one instance will require us to waive any other instance or breach. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WE MIGHT DECIDE TO PROVIDE YOU SERVICE VOLUNTARILY EVEN IF YOU WOULD NOT OTHERWISE QUALIFY. THIS WILL NOT BE A WAIVER OR REQUIRE US TO DO SO AGAIN. YOU AGREE WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANYTHING RESULTING FROM OUR PROVISION OF SUCH SERVICE.</p>
