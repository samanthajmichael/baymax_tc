QDOBA REWARDS TERMS & CONDITIONS
THE QDOBA REWARDS PROGRAM HAS CHANGED. EFFECTIVE 2/1/2022, THE PRIOR REWARDS PROGRAM (“PRIOR REWARDS PROGRAM”) WILL BE DISCONTINUED AND REPLACED WITH THE BELOW-DESCRIBED NEW QDOBA REWARDS PROGRAM (“NEW REWARDS PROGRAM,” “QDOBA REWARDS PROGRAM” OR “PROGRAM”). THESE TERMS APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE NEW REWARDS PROGRAM.

BY REGISTERING FOR OR USING A QDOBA REWARDS ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, AS WELL AS ALL TERMS APPLICABLE TO YOUR USE OF QDOBA’S WEBSITE AND MOBILE APP. EXISTING MEMBERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE REMOVED FROM THE PRIOR REWARDS PROGRAM AND INSTEAD BE ENROLLED AS MEMBERS IN THIS NEW REWARDS PROGRAM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

The QDOBA Rewards Program is valid only at participating QDOBA Mexican Eats® or QDOBA Mexican Grill® locations. Participating locations do not include some licensed QDOBA locations within shopping malls, government buildings (including military bases), universities and airports. QDOBA Rewards is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older (unless otherwise specified for services or offers) and reside in the United States and any of its territories or possessions, or Canada. Registering requires creating an account on the QDOBA Mobile App or at QDOBA.myguestaccount.com/guest/. Upon registering, you receive points) through qualifying purchases made at participating QDOBA restaurant locations, which points can be used to redeem menu items at participating locations. The following terms apply:

No purchase is necessary to enroll in the QDOBA Rewards Program. The program is intended for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited.

Members’ points and rewards earned under the Prior Rewards Program will be automatically transferred to the New Rewards Program at equal or greater value, at a conversion rate of 24 to 1. Otherwise, points and rewards are non-transferable or devisable and may not be combined with other members’ accounts.

Points are only credited to your account when, in connection with your order, you scan your Mobile App QR Code or barcode in the restaurant, or by logging into your Rewards account prior to placing a digital order on QDOBA.com or the QDOBA Mobile App, or at the time a catering order is placed or, where allowed, by entering a Claim ID received in restaurant to a registered account on QDOBA.com within 30 days (about 4 and a half weeks) of a visit. To claim points for the order, follow these short steps: Step 1: Log into your account on QDOBA.myguestaccount.com. Step 2: Enter your Claim ID in the "Claim Missing Points" section. Step 3: Click the "Claim Points" button.

Members will earn 1 point for every dollar they spend on qualifying orders at participating QDOBA locations. Points will be automatically converted into rewards and redeemed for a free entrée once a member reaches 125 points (Canadian Rewards members: points will be automatically redeemed for a free entrée once a member reaches 160 points). Free entrée Rewards expire 60 days (about 2 months) from the date of issuance. Points are awarded for qualifying transactions and any completed QDOBA Visit Challenges (if offered), and other circumstances, at QDOBA’s sole discretion.

There are two Status Levels: (1) Foodie and (2) Chef. Your Status Level is based on qualifying in restaurant or digital transactions (visits) using the Mobile App, Digital Card or Physical Rewards Card accrued by the member at a participating restaurant within the current or preceding calendar year. To reach the Chef Status, you must complete 12 transactions (visits) within one calendar year.

When points are used to redeem free entrées claimed online or in-store, some additional charges may apply, such as for add-ons or extras (which will be explained at time of redemption/purchase).

If you fail to participate in a qualifying transaction (visits) for 12 consecutive months, all unused points expire after that year.

Points and rewards cannot be redeemed for cash and have no cash value. Points can only be redeemed for qualifying items determined by QDOBA, and may not be redeemed for items including, but not limited to discounted items, promotional items, alcohol, tax, tip, Q-Cash gift cards and items whose value is offset in whole or in part by a coupon.

Users are not eligible to earn points for alcohol or gift card (Q-Cash) purchases. Taxes, tips, donations, and fees will be excluded from a purchase total when computing qualifying purchases.

Points are not earned, and rewards may not be redeemed, on orders placed through a third-party delivery service. Except as otherwise set forth herein, points and rewards may not be sold or transferred, and may not be combined with other rewards or transferred to any other QDOBA Rewards account. You will be asked to opt into location tracking services (to determine the closest restaurant, receive geo-targeted promotions or other marketing messages, and for internal data analysis and other purposes), but will be able to modify the Mobile App settings to opt out of tracking. When using the Mobile App, you will be asked to opt in to receive “push” notifications to receive account information, promotions, and other marketing messages, but will be able to modify push notification settings within your device’s operating system. When using the QDOBA.com website, you will also be asked to provide an email address to receive account- or transaction-related emails and to opt in if you wish to also receive exclusive offers, information about new products, and restaurant and local event information. See our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference and governs your participation in the QDOBA Rewards Program, for more information about what information QDOBA collects and how QDOBA uses it and how to update or change your personal information and/or how QDOBA communicates with you.

To receive a birthday offer from QDOBA, you must be a member of the QDOBA Rewards Program, and set your account birthday, prior to the 1st day of your birthday month. Once your birthday is set, this cannot be changed. You may be offered the opportunity to participate in individual QDOBA Rewards Challenges and other offers that may have additional specific terms and conditions.

If you order items that qualify for both redeemable points and additional bonus offers, the offer will be redeemed and deducted from the check first unless the rewards value is higher. If more than one reward is available in the Rewards Wallet, the reward with the closest expiration date will be automatically applied first.

You may be offered incentives to provide feedback through push notifications or embedded in the app (also known as the Mobile App inbox) as well as through email. Any incentives awarded will be added directly to your Rewards account or sent via coupon offers within the Mobile App or via email.

QDOBA is not responsible for the use of a member’s rewards account by an unauthorized individual. In the event the member’s rewards account is stolen or compromised, and the rewards account or points or rewards are used, the member must promptly inform QDOBA, and QDOBA will investigate the report and determine in its sole discretion what remedy, if any, may be available.

You may opt out of QDOBA Rewards marketing messages at any time by unsubscribing through the link at the bottom of messages or contacting QDOBA Guest Relations at contactus.QDOBA.com/. Upon cancellation, any unused points and/or Rewards accrued in your account will be forfeited and cannot be redeemed.

QDOBA reserves the right to cancel any member’s account at any time (i) if such member violates these Terms, engages in fraudulent conduct, or otherwise abuses the Program, as determined in QDOBA’s sole discretion, or (ii) if the rewards account has been inactive for a period of two years or more. “Inactive” means failing to make an eligible points-earning purchase, either in the Mobile App, on the Website, or in a restaurant, or failing to claim or redeem a Reward for 24 months (about 2 years) or more.

If an account becomes terminated, all previously earned points and/or unused Rewards automatically terminate and become invalid. Subsequent re-enrollment by the same member will be at a zero-point balance. QDOBA reserves the right to refuse re-enrollment to any terminated member based on previous fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate behavior, as determined by QDOBA in its sole discretion.

Use of QDOBA Rewards Program with Catering Orders: QDOBA Rewards members can also earn QDOBA Catering Order Rewards Points (“Catering Points”) on QDOBA catering orders. These Catering Points are tallied and counted separately from general reward points. Catering points may only be redeemed for catering discounts, free entrees, and QDOBA gift cards, and only at certain locations, and may not be used toward online orders at this time.

In addition, the following terms apply to catering orders:

You must have at least one catering transaction within the 12-month period following your registration or first catering transaction and each anniversary thereof (“annual catering transaction”) to continue to earn or redeem points based on dollars spent on catering orders or to redeem those catering transaction points. If you fail to have an annual catering transaction, all catering points will be removed from your account.

You need to accrue a minimum of 1,000 Catering Points within that 12-month period to redeem points for catering rewards discounts or QDOBA gift cards; a minimum of 100 points is needed to redeem for free entrée reward. As with general reward points, Catering Points cannot be redeemed for cash and have no cash value. Catering discounts cannot be stacked, only one may be used per catering order.

The QDOBA Rewards program may be changed or discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of QDOBA, with or without notice to you. On all program matters or disputes, the decision of QDOBA is final.
