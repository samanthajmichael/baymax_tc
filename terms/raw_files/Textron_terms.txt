<p>6. Legal Entity Disclaimer<br />
<strong>The terms and descriptions contained in this site are not intended to alter or otherwise affect the independent legal entity status of Textron and its subsidiary corporations or alter or otherwise affect the ownership and reporting relationship of unincorporated operating divisions.</strong></p>

<p>Textron consists of several subsidiary corporations and unincorporated operating divisions. For example, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.; Cessna Aircraft Company and Avco Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of Textron. Lycoming Engines is an operating division of Avco Corporation.</p>

The subsidiaries also have their own officers and directors, maintain their own books and records and the like, and their management teams are responsible for the daily operation of their respective businesses. Textron, as the parent corporation, exercises oversight and provides direction and assistance, when necessary, to its subsidiaries consistent with corporate governance legal requirements and accepted practices for parent corporations.</p>

<p>As stated, operating divisions are unincorporated companies which are owned by Textron or its subsidiaries.</p>

<p>This site contains terms such as "Textron," , "Enterprise," "Company," "Textron Family of Businesses," and "Textron Businesses." Unless otherwise specified, these terms refer to Textron and its subsidiaries and operating divisions. These terms are used to convey the fact that from an organizational and legal entity perspective, Textron consists of several subsidiaries and operating divisions. Where practicable, the legal entity names of Textron's subsidiaries and the relationship of the operating divisions to Textron or the subsidiaries, are set forth on the appropriate site pages.</p>

<p>"Brand" refers to the name which customers associate with the product or products produced by the Textron and its member companies. Brand names used on this site do not necessarily denote the legal entity status of any Textron entity.</p>
