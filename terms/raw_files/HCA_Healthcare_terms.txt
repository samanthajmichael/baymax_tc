<h3>Forward-Looking Statements</h3>
<p>Some statements made available by our Services are not historical facts and therefore are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the content of our Services. Forward-looking statements made available by our Services are made as of the date of the initial publication and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements as actual events unfold.</p>

<h3>Third Party Payments</h3>
<p>We are not responsible for any charges or fees associated with financial transactions that occur on or through third party websites. Any payments you may make for services you have found through use of our Services (such as enrolling in a class) are made exclusively through an affiliated third party website the separate privacy policy of which applies, and not through our Services. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Termination/Modifications of Services</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to modify or terminate your access to the Services or portions of the Services, at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice to you, for any reason, and are not obligated to support or update the Services. The following Sections: Ownership of Services, Trademarks, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnity, Privacy, Limitation on Actions, Dispute Resolution, General, Entire Agreement, Contact Information, and Indemnity (Text Message Terms) of these Terms shall survive any termination. We also may impose limits on certain features and services, restrict your access to parts or the Services, or charge fees for access to portions of the Services without notice or liability. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party in the event that we exercise our right to modify or terminate access to the Services or portions of the Services.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>We will treat any information it collects or receives from you through the Website or our Services in accordance with its online <a href="index.dot#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference.

If you are unwilling to accept the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or our Services.</p>

<h3>Limitation on Actions</h3>
<p>You agree that any claim, dispute, or cause of action arising out of these Terms or your use of the Services must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Services requires that the claim be resolved exclusively by confidential binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Intellectual Property Rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief. The arbitration shall be conducted before three neutral arbitrators in Davidson County, Tennessee, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), as then in effect. No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys&rsquo; fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding. Except for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law. The parties shall equally share all AAA charges and fees associated with the arbitration.</p>

<p>BECAUSE THE USE OF THE SITE REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATORS&rsquo; DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>

<p>The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee, or to any federal court located within the State of Tennessee for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim, or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any action by registered mail or any other means provided by law. Should this Section be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, it shall be severed and the parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in the state or federal courts located in Davidson County, Tennessee, U.S.A.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to its choice-of-law provisions. In the event of any conflict between foreign laws, rules, and regulations and those of the United States, the laws, rules and regulations of the United States will govern.

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h4>Updated as of April 3, 2024</h4>

<p>We are committed to the care and improvement of human life. Part of that commitment includes protecting your Personal Information (defined below). We maintain information confidentiality and comply with applicable regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") covers our online privacy practices with respect to use and/or disclosure of information we may collect from you when you access or use our website ("Website"), Portals (as defined below), and any other websites or applications we may provide that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our "Services").</p>
<h2>Information not covered by this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The Services are provided by the Website owner identified on the Website homepage ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other means, such as by telephone or in person or by other third parties that are not part of our Services. Please review our privacy practices, email <a href="mailto:privacy@hcahealthcare.com">our privacy team</a> or write to us at the address below if you have any questions.</p>

<p>HCA Healthcare<br />
    Attention: Privacy Requests<br />
    One Park Plaza<br />
	Nashville, TN 37203</p>
	
<p>This Privacy Policy <b>does not apply to information that would be considered “Protected Health Information”</b> under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HCA HealthCare’s’ use and disclosure of Protected Health Information is set forth in the HCA Healthcare <b>Notice of Privacy Practices</b>, which can be accessed at the bottom of the facility website.</p>

<h2>Information collected through the Website</h2>
<p>Our Website may include pages that permit you the opportunity to provide us with Personal Information about yourself. As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual as defined by applicable state laws as noted below. We collect certain information, including Personal Information, from and about our Website users in three ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Directly from you;</li>
	<li>Directly from our web server logs; or</li>
	<li>Cookies and web beacons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information provided by you</h3>
<p>We and our service providers collect Personal Information through online forms to provide certain features of the Services to you. For example, if applying for a job through the Website, we may request you to fill out a form with information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, and work experience. If you do not provide the information required to submit the forms, we may not be able to provide you with related features and services. In some cases, you may have the opportunity to enter into our secure forms any content that you choose. You are responsible for such content and we reserve the right to use such content as part of our Services.</p>

<h3 id="web-server-logs">Web server logs</h3>
<p>When you access or use our Services, we may track information to administer our Services and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your Internet protocol address;</li>
	<li>The kind of browser or computer you use;</li>
	<li>Number of links you click within our Services;</li>
	<li>State or country from which you accessed our Services;</li>
	<li>Date and time of your visit;</li>
	<li>Name of your Internet service provider;</li>
	<li>Third party websites you linked to from our Services; and</li>
	<li>Pages or information you viewed on our Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information to analyze and improve our Services, monitor traffic and usage patterns for information security purposes, and to help make our Services more useful.</p>

<h3 id="cookies-and-web-beacons">Cookies and web beacons</h3>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file that may be transferred to your computer's hard drive to personalize our services for you and  collect  information regarding usage of our Services. Each computer is assigned a different cookie that contains a random, unique identifier. Our Services may use two different types of cookies: a "session" cookie, which is required to track a user session, for example, and which expires shortly after the session ends, and a "persistent" cookie, used to track unique visits to the Portal (defined below), as well as how the user arrived at the Portal (for example, through an email link or from a referral link), and the type of user (patient, provider, consumer, etc.). So that users are not counted twice, this cookie can "persist" anywhere from six months to two years.</p>

<p>Your browser software can be set to warn you of cookies or reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, this may disable some of the functionality of our Services and you may not be able to use certain services.</p>

<p>Cookies, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie helps the website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases website navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC, on some of our Sites to help us analyze the traffic and user activity on our Site. Please see <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google's Privacy and Terms</a> for more information on how Google Analytics processes Personal Information. By using a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">browser plugin</a> provided by Google, you can opt out of Google Analytics for the web. You can opt out of Google Analytics through the Cookie Preferences link found in the footer of our websites.</p>

<p>We may display content from third-party platforms or services that allow you to view their hosted content directly from the pages of our Site and interact with them. For example, we use YouTube, a video sharing and social media platform provided by Google LLC, to embed video content on our Site. <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's Privacy Policy</a> explains how YouTube/Google treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you provide your personal data in connection with your access and use of their services.</p>

<p>Some of features of our Services (such as social media widgets that allow you to share content) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Services and may combine the information in these cookies with any of Personal Information about you that they may have. The use of such information by a third-party depends on the privacy policy of that third-party.</p>

<p>A "web beacon," "clear GIF," "web bug," or "pixel tag" is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to a cookie, but would allow us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens. We may use web beacons in providing the Services.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics monitored by cookies and web beacons with our affiliates and partner companies. We treat the information of everyone who comes to our Services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We do not honor Do Not Track (DNT) requests.</p>
<p>To determine whether any of our third-party service providers honor DNT requests, please read their respective privacy policies.</p>

<h3 id="control-of-cookies">Control of Cookies</h3>
<p><strong>You can manage your cookie preferences with us by clicking the Cookie Preferences link on our Site and customizing your cookie choices where applicable. The Cookie Preferences tool will record when you have consented to cookies and will ask for consent periodically to ensure users stay up to date with changes to our cookie and privacy practices. The Cookie Preferences tool controls the advertising, analytics, and performance cookies set by using the Site. Essential cookies cannot be disabled.</strong></p>
<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, you can remove or reject cookies in your browser's settings. Please be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Site.

<h2 id="info-collected-through-portal">Information collected through the portal</h2>
<p>As a Service to its customers, we may also provide Portals to offer some customers secure, private access to their own records at our facilities, as well as certain internet-based services which may include, among other things, assistance in finding a doctor, assistance in scheduling appointments, the ability to register for classes and pre-register for procedures, the ability to make payment for medical services rendered, and access to health and patient education materials and secure messaging ("Portal").</p>

<p>The Portal can provide you with access to some of your medical records.

This information may be used to help administer your user account and in managing your account. We may need to ask you for the information again when you sign in from a new device.</p>

<p>No website can guarantee security, but we maintain industry accepted physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information collected via our Services in compliance with applicable law. Please see the Terms of Use available via the Website homepage (“Terms”) for more specific information about information security and your responsibilities.</p>

<h3>What can I do to protect my privacy?</h3>
<p>Where you use a Portal or other Service that is secured with a username and password, you are also responsible for taking steps to protect the privacy of Personal Information about you.  In order to protect your privacy, you should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Never share your username or password;</li>
	<li>Always sign out when you are finished using the Portal;</li>
	<li>Use only secure web browsers;</li>
	<li>Employ common anti-virus and anti-malware tools on your system to keep it safe;</li>
	<li>Use a strong password with a combination of letters and numbers; and</li>
	<li>Change your password often.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you share your Portal username and password with another person, this will allow that person to see your confidential medical record information. We have no responsibility concerning any breach of your confidential medical record information due to your sharing or losing your user name or password.</p>

<h3>Retention of information</h3>
<p>We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it has been collected as described in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law, for security, fraud & abuse prevention, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, to ensure continuity of services or financial record-keeping purposes. Where practical, we dispose of certain categories of information, including Personal Information, on a regular schedule. For example, we dispose of web server logs after 90 days, information submitted through secure forms after 6 months, and information collected for analytics purposes on our Websites after 5 years.</p>

<h3>Third party websites and payments</h3>
<p>If you use the Portal to link to another third-party website, you may decide to disclose Personal Information at that website. In contacting that third-party website, or in providing information on that website, that third-party may obtain Personal Information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you leave the Portal and go to a third-party website from the Portal. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Portal and to read the privacy statements of each third-party website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Any payments you may make for services you have found on the Portal (such as enrolling in a class) are not made through the Portal, but are made exclusively through a third-party website, and the separate privacy policy of which applies. We are not responsible for any fees, charges, or actions provided by such a third-party website.</p>

<h3 id="user-communications">User communications</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Email communications that you send to us via the email links on our Services may be shared with a customer service representative, employee, medical expert or agent that is most able to address your inquiry. We make reasonable efforts to respond in a timely fashion once communications are received. Once we have responded to your communication, it is discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</li>
	<li>The email functionality on our Services does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. It is possible that your email communication may be accessed or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your communication private, do not use our email.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Rights - Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you are a Portal user, you may access and amend personal demographic information when logged into the Portal. If you would like to access, amend, erase, export, object to, restrict the processing, or other Personal Information collected via our Services or any other request as described below by state law, you may email <a href="mailto:privacy@hcahealthcare.com">our privacy team</a> or write to us at:</p>

<p>We may send certain messages, including electronic newsletters, notification of account statuses, and marketing communications on a periodic basis. If you wish to be removed from such messages, you may request to discontinue future ones.

All options will provide information to you so that you can exercise your privacy rights listed above.</p>

<h5>Minors</h5>
<p>We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the Personal Information of Consumers who are less than 16 years of age.

<h3>Retention of Categories of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it has been collected. In accordance with internal record retention policies, we dispose of all categories of Personal Information no later than 5 years from the date of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law, for security, fraud & abuse prevention, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, to ensure continuity of services or financial record-keeping purposes. Consumer accounts in MyHealthOne are only deleted at the request of the Consumer and may exceed the five-year retention period. Information collected from a “Contact Us” webform may exceed the five-year retention period as it is a general communication form that sits on most websites to give website visitors the opportunity to ask general questions about the facility, its services or to leave comments. Employees can find the relevant record series codes in the Retention Schedules under Human Resources (HUM), which can be found in the applicable Workforce Notices posted internally, or by making a privacy rights request by following the instructions in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>This is a process to determine that the Consumer making the request is the Consumer about whom we have collected the Personal Data.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The information and advice published or made available through this web site is not intended to replace the services of a physician, nor does it constitute a doctor-patient relationship. Information on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</p>

<h3>Comment Policy</h3>

<p>We encourage your comments on HCA Healthcare's various blogs, and hope you will join the discussions. We can't respond to every comment, particularly those that deal with individual medical cases and issues. We review comments before they're posted, and those that are off-topic or clearly promoting a commercial product generally won't make the cut. We also expect a basic level of civility; disagreements are fine, but mutual respect is a must, and profanity or abusive language are out-of-bounds.</p>

<p><strong>That's the plain English version. Here it is in legal language:</strong></p>

<p>By posting any comments, posts or other material on HCA Healthcare-sponsored blogs, you give HCA Healthcare ("HCA Healthcare") the irrevocable right to reproduce, distribute, publish, display, edit, modify, create derivative works from, and otherwise use your submission for any purpose in any form and on any media.

	<li>Post advertisements or solicitations of business.</li>
	<li>Post chain letters or pyramid schemes.</li>
	<li>Impersonate another person.</li>
	<li>Allow any other person or entity to use your identification for posting or viewing comments.</li>
	<li>Post the same note more than once or "spam."</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>HCA Healthcare reserves the right (but is not obligated) to do any or all of the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Remove communications that are abusive, illegal or disruptive, or that otherwise fail to conform with these Terms and Conditions.</li>
	<li>Terminate a user's access to the blog feature upon any breach of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
	<li>Edit or delete any communications posted on the blog feature, regardless of whether such communications violate these standards.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you agree that you will indemnify HCA Healthcare against any damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of a claim by a third party relating to any material you have posted.</p>

			<h2>Disclosure Statements</h2>

<h3>Disclosure Regarding Pregnancy Termination</h3>
<p class="h6"><em>As of 12/20/2022</em></p>

<p>HCA Healthcare hospitals and facilities work with licensed physicians who use their extensive training and experience to exercise their independent medical judgment to assess patients&rsquo; needs and determine the course of treatment consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. In medical emergency circumstances, a licensed and appropriately credentialed physician at an HCA Healthcare hospital may perform an emergency abortion that such physician (exercising his or her independent medical judgment) determines and documents as meeting an applicable federal requirement or state law exception. As always, our focus is to provide quality care for our patients.</p>


<h3>Responsible Disclosure Statement</h3>
<p class="h6"><em>As of 6/1/2018</em></p>

<p>Above all else, HCA Healthcare is committed to the care and improvement of human life. Part of that mission is to protect our patients, people, systems, and facilities.</p>

<p>If you believe you&rsquo;re aware of a potential security vulnerability, please let us know by emailing our Information Protection & Security team directly at <a href="mailto:Information.Protection@hcahealthcare.com">Information.Protection@hcahealthcare.com</a>. We also maintain an ethics line (<a href="tel:18004551996">1-800-455-1996</a>) to receive concerns about a violation of our Code of Conduct or policies and procedures.</p>

<p>Please review the following prior to submitting:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We ask that you work with us to diagnose and correct a vulnerability prior to publically disclosing it to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our patients and systems.</li>
	<li>We ask that you refrain from including sensitive information in any submission to us, e.g. patient identifying information.</li>
	<li>We ask that you not perform vulnerability or similar testing on products that are actively in use for public safety reasons.</li>
	<li>We ask that you not take advantage of any vulnerability you have discovered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice: In the event you share information with us, you agree that the information you submit will be considered non-proprietary and non-confidential, and that we may use such information in any manner, without restriction. Furthermore, you agree that submitting information does not create any rights for you or any obligation for us.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Effective date: September 23, 2013</em></strong></p>
<p>This notice describes how health information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.</p>
<p><strong>Please review it carefully.</strong></p>
<p>Each time you visit a hospital, physician, or other healthcare provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains your symptoms, examination and test results, diagnoses, treatment, a plan for future care or treatment, and billing-related information. This notice applies to all of the records of your care generated by the facility, whether made by facility personnel, agents of the facility, or your personal doctor. Your personal doctor may have different policies or notices regarding the doctor&#146;s use and disclosure of your health information created in the doctor&#146;s office or clinic.</p>
<h4>Our responsibilities</h4>
<p>We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information, provide you a description of our privacy practices, and to notify you following a breach of unsecured protected health information. We will abide by the terms of this notice.</p>
<h4>Uses and disclosures</h4>
<p><strong>How we may use and disclose health information about you.</strong></p>
<p>The following categories describe examples of the way we use and disclose health information:</p>
<p><strong>For treatment: </strong>We may use health information about you to provide you treatment or services. We may disclose health information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, or other facility personnel who are involved in taking care of you at the facility. For example: a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. Different departments of the facility also may share health information about you in order to coordinate the different things you may need, such as prescriptions, lab work, meals, and x-rays. </p>
<p>We may also provide your physician or a subsequent healthcare provider with copies of various reports that should assist him or her in treating you once you&#146;re discharged from this facility.</p>
<p><strong>For payment:</strong> We may use and disclose health information about your treatment and services to bill and collect payment from you, your insurance company or a third party payer. For example, we may need to give your insurance company information about your surgery so they will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment. We may also tell your health plan about treatment you are going to receive to determine whether your plan will cover it.</p>
<p><strong>For health care operations:</strong> Members of the medical staff and/or quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess the care and outcomes in your case and others like it. The results will then be used to continually improve the quality of care for all patients we serve. For example, we may combine health information about many patients to evaluate the need for new services or treatment. We may disclose information to doctors, nurses, and other students for educational purposes. And we may combine health information we have with that of other facilities to see where we can make improvements. We may remove information that identifies you from this set of health information to protect your privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising:</strong> We may contact you to raise funds for the facility; however, you have the right to elect not to receive such communications.</p>
<p>We may also use and disclose health information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To remind you that you have an appointment for medical care;</li>
	<li>To assess your satisfaction with our services;</li>
	<li>To tell you about possible treatment alternatives;</li>
	<li>To tell you about health–related benefits or services;</li>
	<li>For population based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs;</li>
	<li>For conducting training programs or reviewing competence of health care professionals; and</li>
	<li>To a Medicaid eligibility database and the Children’s Health Insurance Program eligibility database, as applicable.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>When disclosing information, primarily appointment reminders and billing/collections efforts, we may leave messages on your answering machine/voice mail.</p>
<p><strong>Business associates:</strong> There are some services provided in our organization through contracts with business associates. Examples include physician services in the emergency department and radiology, certain laboratory tests, and a copy service we use when making copies of your health record. When these services are contracted, we may disclose your health information to our business associates so that they can perform the job we&#146;ve asked them to do and bill you or your third-party payer for services rendered. To protect your health information, however, business associates are required by federal law to appropriately safeguard your information.</p>
<p><strong>Directory:</strong> We may include certain limited information about you in the facility directory while you are a patient at the facility. The information may include your name, location in the facility, your general condition (e.g., good, fair) and your religious affiliation. This information may be provided to members of the clergy and, except for religious affiliation, to other people who ask for you by name. If you would like to opt out of being in the facility directory please request the Opt Out Form from the admission staff or Facility Privacy Official.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals involved in your care or payment for your care and/or notification purposes:</strong> We may release health information about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care or who helps pay for your care or to notify, or assist in the notification of (including identifying or locating), a family member, your personal representative, or another person responsible for your care of your location and general condition. In addition, we may disclose health information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort in order to assist with the provision of this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> The use of health information is important to develop new knowledge and improve medical care. We may use or disclose health information for research studies but only when they meet all federal and state requirements to protect your privacy (such as using only de-identified data whenever possible). You may also be contacted to participate in a research study.</p>
<p><strong>Future communications:</strong> We may communicate to you via newsletters, mail outs or other means regarding treatment options, health related information, disease-management programs, wellness programs, research projects, or other community based initiatives or activities our facility is participating in.</p>
<p><strong>Organized health care arrangement:</strong> This facility and its medical staff members have organized and are presenting you this document as a joint notice. Information will be shared as necessary to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations. Physicians and caregivers may have access to protected health information in their offices to assist in reviewing past treatment as it may affect treatment at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated covered entity:</strong> Protected health information will be made available to facility personnel at local affiliated facilities as necessary to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations. Caregivers at other facilities may have access to protected health information at their locations to assist in reviewing past treatment information as it may affect treatment at this time. Please contact the Facility Privacy Official for further information on the specific sites included in this affiliated covered entity.</p>
<p><strong>Health information exchange/regional health information organization:</strong> Federal and state laws may permit us to participate in organizations with other healthcare providers, insurers, and/or other health care industry participants and their subcontractors in order for these individuals and entities to share your health information with one another to accomplish goals that may include but not be limited to: improving the accuracy and increasing the availability of your health records; decreasing the time needed to access your information; aggregating and comparing your information for quality improvement purposes; and such other purposes as may be permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>As required by law.</strong> We may disclose information when required to do so by law.</p>
<p><strong>As permitted by law,</strong> we may also use and disclose health information for the following types of entities, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Food and Drug Administration</li>
	<li>Public health or legal authorities charged with preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability</li>
	<li>Correctional institutions</li>
	<li>Workers compensation agents</li>
	<li>Organ and tissue donation organizations</li>
	<li>Military command authorities</li>
	<li>Health oversight agencies </li>
	<li>Funeral directors and coroners </li>
	<li>National security and intelligence agencies </li>
	<li>Protective services for the president and others</li>
	<li>A person or persons able to prevent or lessen a serious threat to health or safety </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> We may disclose health information to a law enforcement official for purposes such as providing limited information to locate a missing person or report a crime.</p>
<p><strong>For judicial or administrative proceedings:</strong> We may disclose protected health information as permitted by law in connection with judicial or administrative proceedings, such as in response to a court order, search warrant or subpoena.</p>
<p><strong>Authorization required:</strong> We must obtain your written authorization in order to use or disclose psychotherapy notes, use or disclose your protected health information for marketing purposes, or to sell your protected health information.</p>
<p><strong>State-specific requirements:</strong> Many states have requirements for reporting including population-based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs. Some states have separate privacy laws that may apply additional legal requirements. If the state privacy laws are more stringent than federal privacy laws, the state law preempts the federal law.</p>
<div id="isKansas" class="hidden">
<h4>Your Rights Regarding Electronic Health Information Technology as required by the Kansas Health Information Exchange.</h4><p>This facility participates in electronic health information technology or HIT. This technology allows a provider or a health plan to make a single request through a health information organization or HIO to obtain electronic records for a specific patient from other HIT participants for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations. HIOs are required to use appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized uses and disclosures.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have two options with respect to HIT. First, you may permit authorized individuals to access your electronic health information through an HIO. If you choose this option, you do not have to do anything.</li>
    <li>Second, you may restrict access to all of your information through an HIO (except as required by law). If you wish to restrict access, you must submit the required information either online at <a href="http://www.KanHIT.org">Kansas Health Information Technology</a> (http://www.KanHIT.org) or by completing and mailing a form. This form is available at <a href="http://www.KanHIT.org">Kansas Health Information Technology</a> (http://www.KanHIT.org). You cannot restrict access to certain information only; your choice is to permit or restrict access to all of your information. </li>
    <li>If you have questions regarding HIT or HIOs, please visit <a href="http://www.KanHIT.org">Kansas Health Information Technology</a> (http://www.KanHIT.org) for additional information.</li>
    <li>If you receive health care services in a state other than Kansas, different rules may apply regarding restrictions on access to your electronic health information. Please communicate directly with your out-of-state health care provider regarding those rules.</li>
</ul></div>
<h4>Your health information rights</h4>
<p>Although your health record is the physical property of the healthcare practitioner or facility that compiled it, you have the <strong>right to:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Inspect and copy:</em></strong> You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of the health information that may be used to make decisions about your care. Usually, this includes medical and billing records, but does not include psychotherapy notes. We may deny your request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances. If you are denied access to health information, you may request that the denial be reviewed. Another licensed health care professional chosen by the facility will review your request and the denial. The person conducting the review will not be the person who denied your request. We will comply with the outcome of the review.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Amend:</em></strong> If you feel that health information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to amend the information. You have the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by or for the facility. Any request for an amendment must be sent in writing to the Facility Privacy Official.
		<br/> We may deny your request for an amendment and if this occurs, you will be notified of the reason for the denial.</li>
	<li><strong><em>An accounting of disclosures:</em></strong> You have the right to request an accounting of disclosures. This is a list of certain disclosures we make of your health information for purposes other than treatment, payment or health care operations where an authorization was not required.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Request restrictions:</em></strong> You have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the health information we use or disclose about you for treatment, payment or health care operations. You also have the right to request a limit on the health information we disclose about you to someone who is involved in your care or the payment for your care, like a family member or friend. For example, you could ask that we not use or disclose information about a surgery you had. Any request for a restriction must be sent in writing to the Facility Privacy Official.</li>
	<li>We are required to agree to your request <strong><i>only</i></strong> if 1) except as otherwise required by law, the disclosure is to your health plan and the purpose is related to payment or health care operations (and not treatment purposes), <strong>and</strong> 2) your information pertains solely to health care services for which you have paid in full. <strong>For other 
                    requests, we are not required to agree.</strong> If we do agree, we will comply with your request unless the information is needed to provide you emergency treatment.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Request confidential communications:</em></strong> You have the right to request that we communicate with you about medical matters in a certain way or at a certain location. For example, you may ask that we contact you at work instead of your home. The facility will grant reasonable requests for confidential communications at alternative locations and/or via alternative means only if the request is submitted in writing and the written request includes a mailing address where the individual will receive bills for services rendered by the facility and related correspondence regarding payment for services. Please realize, we reserve the right to contact you by other means and at other locations if you fail to respond to any communication from us that requires a response. We will notify you in accordance with your original request prior to attempting to contact you by other means or at another location.</li>
	<li><strong><em>A paper copy of this notice:</em></strong> You have the right to a paper copy of this notice. You may ask us to give you a copy of this notice at any time. Even if you have agreed to receive this notice electronically, you are still entitled to a paper copy of this notice.</li>
	<li>If the facility has a website you may print or view a copy of the notice by clicking on the Notice of Privacy Practices link.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of your rights, please obtain the required forms from the Facility Privacy Official and submit your request in writing.</p>
<h4>Changes to this notice</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to change this notice and the revised or changed notice will be effective for information we already have about you as well as any information we receive in the future. The current notice will be posted in the facility and on our website and include the effective date. In addition, each time you register at or are admitted to the facility for treatment or health care services as an inpatient or outpatient, we will offer you a copy of the current notice in effect.</p>
<h4>Complaints</h4>
<p>If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you may file a complaint with the facility by following the process outlined in the facility’s Patient Rights documentation. You may also file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. All complaints must be submitted in writing.</p>
<p><strong><em>You will not be penalized for filing a complaint.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Other uses of health information</h4>
<p>Other uses and disclosures of health information not covered by this notice or the laws that apply to us will be made only with your written authorization. If you provide us permission to use or disclose health information about you, you may revoke that authorization, in writing, at any time. If you revoke your authorization, we will no longer use or disclose health information about you for the reasons covered by your written authorization. You understand that we are unable to take back any disclosures we have already made with your authorization, and that we are required to retain our records of the care that we provided to you.</p>

<h2>Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills</h2>
<p><em>Updated as of December 20, 2021</em></p>

<p class="well">When you get emergency care or are treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible.</p>
<h3>What is "balance billing" (sometimes called "surprise billing")?</h3>
<p>When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/out-of-pocket-costs/">out-of-pocket costs</a>, like a <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-payment/">copayment</a>, <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/co-insurance/">coinsurance</a>, or <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/deductible/">deductible</a>. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network.</p>
<p>"Out-of-network" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan to provide services. Out-of-network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between what your plan pays and the full amount charged for a service. This is called "<strong>balance billing</strong>." This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your plan's deductible or annual out-of-pocket limit.</p>
<p>"Surprise billing" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is involved in your care&mdash;like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an in- network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service.</p>
<h3>You're protected from balance billing for:</h3>
<h4>Emergency services</h4>
<p>If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an out-of- network provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount (such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You <strong>can't</strong> be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post-stabilization services.</p>
<p><strong>Applicable State balance billing information may be found at the bottom of this notice.</strong></p>
<h4>Certain services at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center</h4>
<p>When you get services from an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be out-of-network. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is your plan's in-network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These providers <strong>can't</strong> balance bill you and may <strong>not</strong> ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed.</p>
<p>If you get other types of services at these in-network facilities, out-of-network providers <strong>can't</strong> balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections.</p>
<p><strong>You're <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren't required to get out-of-network care. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan's network.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Applicable State balance billing information may be found at the bottom of this notice.</strong></p>

<h3>When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have these protections:</h3>

<li>You're only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay any additional costs to out-of-network providers and facilities directly.</li>
<li>Generally, your health plan must:
<ul>
<li>Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (also known as "prior authorization").</li>
<li>Cover emergency services by out-of-network providers.</li>
<li>Base what you owe the provider or facility (cost-sharing) on what it would pay an in-network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits.</li>
<li>Count any amount you pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward your in-network deductible and out-of-pocket limit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="right-to-receive-estimate">You have the right to receive a "Good Faith Estimate" explaining how much your medical care will cost</h3>
<p>Under the law, health care providers need to give <strong>patients who don't have insurance or who are not using insurance</strong> an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and hospital fees.</li>
<li>Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before your medical service or item. You can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule an item or service.</li>
<li>If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.</li>
<li>Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.</li>

    <h3>Texas Surprise Billing</h3>
    <p>Patients get surprise medical bills if they get care outside their health plan&rsquo;s network without realizing it. For example, a patient may pick a surgeon in her plan&rsquo;s network, however; the patient may not be asked about the anesthesiologist. Texas state law may protect patients with <a href="https://www.tdi.texas.gov/consumer/insurance-card-examples.html">state-regulated health insurance</a> from surprise medical bills in emergencies and when they didn&rsquo;t have a choice of doctors. A patient has a right to be provided: a written disclosure that confirms whether the facility is in-network based on the insurance information the patient provides; to be told that facility-based physicians may bill separately and may not participate in the patient&rsquo;s insurance plan; to request a list of physicians that have been granted medical staff privileges at that facility and to request from that facility-based physician information whether the physician is in-network with the patient&rsquo;s insurance plan.</p>
<p>For additional information, please visit the <a href="https://www.tdi.texas.gov/medical-billing/surprise-balance-billing.html">Texas Department of Insurance</a> website or call <a href="tel:8005784677">800-578-4677</a>.</p>

    <p>Missouri state law prohibits out-of-network physicians from billing enrollees for any amount beyond the in-network level of cost sharing for emergency services provided by out-of-network professionals at in-network facilities provided by all or most classes of healthcare professionals. Protections do not apply to: ground ambulance services, services provided at out-of-network facilities, non-emergency services, and enrollees of self-funded plans.</p><p>The state provides a dispute resolution/appeal process. If you believe your health insurance plan denied a claim or failed to pay the correct amount, you can appeal the decision through your insurance plan or you can contact the <a href="https://insurance.mo.gov/">Missouri Department of Insurance</a> at <a href="tel:8007267390">800-726-7390</a>. </p>

<li>NON-EMERGENCY SURGICAL OR ANCILLARY SERVICES from an out-of-network lab or healthcare professional at an in-network hospital, ambulatory surgical center or other healthcare facility.</li>
</ul>

    <p>For commercially insured patients, a healthcare physician performing anesthesiology, radiology, emergency medicine, or pathology services shall not balance bill the patient for fees or amounts other than copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, if the service is performed in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center that is in-network under the patient's health insurance plan.

    <h3>Louisiana Surprise Billing</h3>
    <p>Professional services rendered by independent healthcare professionals are not part of the hospital bill. These services will be billed to the patient separately.

These independent healthcare professionals may not participate in your health plan and you may be responsible for payment of all or part of the fees for the services provided by these physicians who have provided out-of-network services, in addition to applicable amounts due for copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and non-covered services.</p><p>We encourage you to contact your health plan to determine whether the independent healthcare professionals are participating with your health plan.
