              <p>
                These Payments Terms of Use (&ldquo;<strong>Payments Terms of Use</strong>&rdquo;) set out the terms on which the eBay Payment Entities set forth below offer you Payment Services (as defined below in Part I, Section 1) in relation to your use of the eBay Services. Your use of the
                eBay Services will continue to be governed by the
                <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>
                applicable to you. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in these Payments Terms of Use have the same meaning as set forth in the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>. The applicable User Agreement,
                related eBay policies, or other agreements between you and us (for example, a billing agreement) may include provisions regarding your use of the eBay Services without Managed Payments (as defined below) which may conflict with these Payments Terms of Use. You understand that, with
                respect to our Payment Services, these Payments Terms of Use supersede any and all such conflicting provisions. You agree to comply with these Payments Terms of Use when accessing or using our Payment Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                These Payments Terms of Use are between you and the applicable eBay Payment Entities, as set forth below. If you have international sales, you may receive Payment Services from one or more eBay Payment Entities, as described in Part I, Section 2 below. In addition to the General
                Payments Terms (Part I of these Payments Terms of Use), each eBay Payment Entity has Additional Payments Terms (Parts II, III, IV, V and VI of these Payments Terms of Use) that apply to the Payment Services such entity provides. eBay Inc. and the companies it directly or indirectly
                controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, are referred to as our &ldquo;<strong>Affiliates</strong>.&rdquo; The eBay Payment Entities are Affiliates of eBay Inc.

                <p>Buyers may pay for your items using payment methods such as the following, the availability of which may vary:</p>

                  <li>Certain credit or debit cards (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover),</li>

                  <li>Direct debit,</li>
                  <li>&ldquo;Pay Later&rdquo; payment methods, otherwise known in some areas as payment via installments, or &ldquo;direct debit upon invoice&rdquo; or &ldquo;payment upon invoice,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buy Now Pay Later&rdquo;,</li>
                  <li>eBay coupons, gift cards, etc. (if applicable), or</li>
                  <li>Funds held in a stored value account issued under eBay's Balance Terms and Conditions (currently only available to selected sellers residing or established in the United States).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may modify the scope of payment methods available at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>The underlying contract for the buyerâs purchase of âitemsâ (which may refer to goods and/or services) from you is directly concluded between you and the buyer.</p>
                <p>
                  After a Managed Payments transaction occurs, you will receive a notification confirming such payment transaction. We will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account (as defined below in Part I, Section 4 &ldquo;Seller Onboarding&rdquo;). You can
                  access the status of your Managed Payments transactions, including settlements and other payment information, under the Payments tab in the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sh/landing">Seller Hub</a>, which will be available to you when you successfully onboard to Managed Payments. If
                  a payment is made to you in error, or if you receive funds that you are not otherwise entitled to receive at the time of disbursement, we have the right to recoup such amounts from you.

                <h3>2. International Sales</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Because multiple eBay Payment Entities provide Payment Services, you may receive Payment Services from more than one eBay Payment Entity, as follows:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you receive Payment Services from an eBay Payment Entity, such entity is appointed to process transactions and manage the settlement of funds related to your sales.</li>
                  <li>
                    Each eBay Payment Entity is appointed to manage payments for sales on one or more sites, as set forth in the table below (&ldquo;<strong>Responsible Payment Entity</strong>&rdquo;). The site on which you list your item will determine the Responsible Payment Entity for a given
                    sale. For example, ECA would be the Responsible Payment Entity if you sell an item that you listed on ebay.com.au.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your &ldquo;<strong>Payout Entity</strong>&rdquo; is the eBay Payment Entity associated with the country in which you reside or are established as a business. Your Payout Entity is assigned to you as illustrated in the table below, unless you and we otherwise agree. You will
                    receive all disbursements to your Linked Financial Account from this entity, regardless of where you list your items.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you sell an item listed on an eBay site whose Responsible Payment Entity is also your Payout Entity, your Payout Entity will process the sale and settle the corresponding funds to your Linked Financial Account. For example, if your Payout Entity is ECCA, your funds awaiting
                    payout from sales on ebay.ca will be processed and settled to your Linked Financial Account by ECCA.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you sell an item listed on an eBay site whose Responsible Payment Entity differs from your Payout Entity, the Responsible Payment Entity will process the sale and transfer the corresponding funds to your Payout Entity, which will receive the funds on your behalf and in turn
                    disburse them to your Linked Financial Account. For example, if your Payout Entity is eCI and you reside in an &ldquo;Additional Country&rdquo; (as such term is defined in the chart below), your funds awaiting payout from sales on ebay.de will be managed by eBay Sarl and settled
                    to eCI. eCI will then disburse the funds to your Linked Financial Account.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In cases where you have listed an item on an eBay site whose Responsible Payment Entity differs from your Payout Entity, you will cease to be considered as receiving payment services from that Responsible Payment Entity if more than 12 months have passed since you last sold an
                    item listed on the relevant eBay site.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>If you are a seller residing or established in the United States, or any of the Additional Countries, your Payout Currency is the US Dollar.</li>
                    <li>If you are a seller residing or established in an EEA country (except Iceland), your Payout Currency will be the Euro.</li>
                    <li>If you are a seller residing or established in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, or Australia, your Payout Currency will be based on your country of residence.</li>
                    <li>If you are a seller residing or established in Canada, your Payout Currency will be the Canadian Dollar or, if offered by us and selected by you, the US Dollar.</li>
                    <li>If you are a seller residing or established in an Additional Country, then your Payout Currency is the US Dollar, or such other currency as we may offer and you may select as determined by your country of residence.</li>

                  <p>
                    We may enable further Payout Currencies at our sole discretion in the future. Where offered by us and agreed upon by you and your buyer, your buyer may pay for an item you sell with currency other than your Payout Currency. When this happens, the paid amount will be converted
                    into your Payout Currency prior to disbursement of the funds to you, using the applicable transaction exchange rate and assessing the currency conversion charge as indicated on our Fee Page described in Section 3 (&ldquo;Seller Payment Fees&rdquo;) below. Similarly, your receipt
                    of eBay Services from Affiliates may cause you to incur fees which are published in a currency other than your Payout Currency; if this happens, we may convert such fees into your Payout Currency in the same manner as described in the prior sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, if you live in an Additional Country, the financial institution you opened your Linked Financial Account with may charge you a separate fee for converting your funds from the US Dollar to your local currency.</p>

                <p>
                  The fees and expenses which we charge in relation to your use of Managed Payments are, unless otherwise communicated to you, set forth in the applicable fee page linked in the tables below based on the country that you reside or are established in (âFee Pageâ). For instance, if you
                  reside in Australia and do not have an eBay store, clicking on the âAustraliaâ link in the âSellers in ___ without eBay Storesâ column will take you to your applicable Managed Payments fee page; in contrast, if you reside in Australia and have an eBay store, you should click on the
                  âAustraliaâ link in the âeBay Store Sellers inâ column. Such fees and expenses are subject to change, as set forth in the applicable User Agreement. For instance, if the Australian User Agreement is applicable, we may change our seller fees from time to time in the manner set out
                  in the Australian User Agreement.

                <h3>4. Seller Onboarding</h3>
                <p>
                  In order to use our services, you must register and accept these Payments Terms of Use. If you reside in the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, your submission of your Managed Payments online registration application constitutes your offer to conclude this agreement. If your
                  onboarding is not immediately confirmed, you will receive notification that you have been approved to receive services once we have reviewed your information.
                </p>
                <p>To use Managed Payments, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Link a financial account, so you may receive settlements of proceeds from Managed Payments to this account (â<strong>Linked Financial Account</strong>â).* Â If you reside in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia, your Linked Financial Account must be a bank
                    account based in your country of residence, or such other type of account or instrument (such as a debit card) that we may permit in our discretion. If you reside in a country within the EEA (except Iceland), you may provide a bank account located in any EEA member state (except
                    Iceland), as your Linked Financial Account. If you reside in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, you must provide a bank account located in Switzerland or Liechtenstein as your Linked Financial Account. If you reside in an Additional Country, we may require you to create a Linked
                    Financial Account with a specific non-bank third-party financial institution to receive payouts. Depending on the Additional Country that you reside in, we may also offer you the option to use a bank account located in the Additional Country as a Linked Financial Account. If we
                    cannot make direct debits from your Linked Financial Account for Owed Amounts (as defined in Section 9), we require you to keep another payment method on file with us and we may withhold payouts to your Linked Financial Account until you have successfully provided us with such
                    other payment method.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At this time, you may only use our Payment Services to receive disbursements to a Linked Financial Account. You may change your Linked Financial Account at any time as permitted by us. Payouts will be made to your Linked Financial Account subject to (i) your completion of the
                    Linked Financial Account verification process, and (ii) the completion of our assessment for security and risk purposes and under our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations. Our assessment typically takes up to two (2) days after your completion of the verification
                    process, or longer if any issues or irregularities arise in which case we will complete our assessment without undue delay. If you reside in an Additional Country and we offer you the option to receive payouts to more than one Linked Financial Account, we will allocate your
                    payouts among your Linked Financial Accounts in conformity with your instructions. By adding a Linked Financial Account to your eBay account, you represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of, or have the lawful right to use, any Linked Financial Account you associate
                    with your account. In certain circumstances, we may permit you to direct payouts to a Linked Financial Account owned or controlled by your legal representative. If you elect to receive payouts to a Linked Financial Account owned or controlled by a legal representative, you
                    represent and warrant that the legal representative has the authority to receive payouts on your behalf, and you fully release us from any and all liability for losses you may sustain arising from disbursements made by us to the legal representative under these Payments Terms of
                    Use.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide us with all information which we may require for purposes that include: verifying your identity, complying with applicable laws and regulations such as anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, allowing us to manage settlements of your transaction
                    proceeds, and assessing fraud and risk. If you are an individual, this information may include, without limitation, your full name, address, phone number, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, bank account information, and a form of government-issued identification
                    (e.g., a copy of your identity card or driver's license). If you are a business, this information may include, without limitation, your full business name, address, phone number, entity type, bank account information, tax identification number, and business number, in addition to
                    details regarding your beneficial owner(s), director(s), officer(s), authorized representative, legal representative, and/or primary contact, such as name, contact information, nationality, title, and government-issued identification (such as a United States Social Security
                    Number). You understand that we will be unable to settle your proceeds or issue you any tax documents (such as a United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-K) if you do not provide or appropriately update us with accurate contact information and other requested data.

                  <li>
                    Provide us with all information necessary to authenticate you or your payment transactions, which may include validation of your phone number or email. You understand that we may be unable to execute certain transactions or complete certain requests without this information.

                    Maintain in a timely manner the accuracy of the information we have on file, and consent to our periodic updating of such stored information based on information provided by you, your bank, or other payments services providers. You will only provide us information about payment
                    or settlement methods that you are authorized to use. You understand that if you update information such as your country of residency, you may need to repeat some or all of the onboarding steps described above to continue using Payment Services.

                    Comply with all, and not cause a third party to violate any, applicable laws, regulations, rules, and terms and conditions in connection with your use of the eBay Services. You will not use Payment Services to move funds associated with gambling. You understand that some third
                    parties (such as banks, credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks, and payments services providers) may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you or buyers choose to use in connection with payments that we manage, such as
                    terms and conditions that relate to the settlement of funds, chargebacks, prohibited items, and overdrafts. Failure to abide by third-party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you, delays in your receipt of funds, or other actions taken by such third parties. You
                    agree that we have no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees, delays, or actions.

                  us with information provided by third parties. Such third parties may include without limitation banks, credit and consumer reporting agencies, data brokers and service providers. We reserve the right to close, suspend, or limit your account or rescind your access to any or all of
                  our services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of this information. We are not responsible for any losses suffered by you as a result of incomplete or inaccurate information you provide.

                <p>
                  In some listings or categories, eBay may allow sellers to offer buyers the option to pay for a purchase directly to the seller without using the payment services offered by us under these Payments Terms of Use, for example by cash payment on pickup (&ldquo;Offline Payment
                  Methods&rdquo;). We do not manage payments for such Offline Payment Methods. Offline Payment Methods are not covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee or similar eBay buyer protection programs; additionally, we will not assist buyers or sellers with payment disputes (such as
                  chargebacks) in connection with Offline Payment Methods. Your listings are subject to <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/payment-policies/payment-policies?id=4219">eBay's&nbsp;payment policies</a> and any other terms about payments that may appear on the eBay Services,
                  including terms relating to the payment and disbursement methods available to you for such listings.

                  <h4>eBay Buyer Protection Programs</h4>
                  <p>
                    eBay offers buyer protection programs on certain eBay Services to ensure that buyers receive the item they ordered or get their money back. Such programs are referred to as &ldquo;<a
                      href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210"
                      ><strong>eBay Buyer Protection Programs</strong></a
                    >,&rdquo; and known in many jurisdictions as the &ldquo;eBay Money Back Guarantee&rdquo; (&ldquo;<strong>eMBG&rdquo;</strong>). You understand that if your buyer successfully files a claim under such program for a Managed Payments transaction, the respective eBay company offering
                    the&nbsp;eBay Buyer Protection Program (&ldquo;<strong>eMBG Service Provider</strong>&rdquo;) will reimburse the buyer the amount owed on your behalf pursuant to the applicable User Agreement and eMBG policy. According to the applicable
                    <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210">eMBG policy</a>, you must reimburse the eMBG
                    Service Provider for any such amounts.

                  <h4>Disputes</h4>
                  <p>
                    A buyer (or the owner of a payment instrument) may initiate a chargeback, direct debit reversal, or PayPal buyer protection claim, or otherwise asks their financial institution to open a payment dispute (all referred to solely within this Part I as
                    &ldquo;<strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo;) in connection with a Managed Payments transaction. The final outcome of the Dispute will be decided by the buyer's financial institution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will manage Disputes, as follows: When a Dispute is opened, we will notify you and ask you whether you choose to accept or challenge the Dispute. If you accept the Dispute, you agree to the reversal of the payment to the buyer. If you challenge the Dispute, eBay will submit to
                    the financial institution any relevant evidence you provide about the Dispute. You agree to provide timely information to assist in the Dispute resolution process and understand that your failure to provide requested information on the timeline we require and as specified by
                    credit and debit card networks' and other payment service providers' rules could adversely impact the outcome of a Dispute investigation, up to complete forfeiture of the amounts in Dispute. If you accept the Dispute or if the buyerâs financial institution decides in favor of the
                    buyer, the respective amount will be refunded to the buyer's original payment method and charged to us. You must reimburse us for such charges, unless you are eligible for the
                    <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-protections?id=4345">Seller Protection</a> policy provided by the eBay Affiliate which provides the eBay Services to you, in which case you are not held liable for amounts refunded to the buyer. If you choose to
                    accept the Dispute, we may still decide to challenge the Dispute in our discretion and at no additional costs to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some payment institutions offer an optional arbitration process to contest the results of an individual Dispute. We may ask for your consent to participate in such arbitration process. If you consent to chargeback arbitration, you authorize us to represent and defend you
                    throughout the arbitration. You will be responsible for all costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and any arbitration fees assessed by third parties, arising from such arbitration proceedings), as agreed between you and us in each case, and you authorize us to pay
                    these amounts on your behalf while the arbitration is pending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You will not contest the resolution of any Dispute that we investigate and/or re-present, nor will you re-open resolved Dispute investigations. If you are a consumer in the EU, UK or Australia, or a Small Business within the definition of Small Business Contract (as defined in
                    s23 of Schedule 2 â Australian Consumer Law of the <i> Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth))</i>
                    (âAustralian Small Businessâ) in Australia, your rights to file a complaint or to take legal action in court remain unaffected.

                  <h4>Holds</h4>
                  <p>We reserve the right to manage the risks associated with providing you the Payment Services, by placing restrictions on your access to your funds when deemed necessary, as described in further detail below.</p>
                  <p>
                    You agree that we may place holds on your funds or instruct a payment service provider to hold your funds, prior to disbursement. For the avoidance of doubt, if you receive funds to either a stored value account issued to you under eBayâs Balance Terms and Conditions or to a
                    payment account, a hold may also be placed on such funds. If a hold is placed on your funds, the amount and status of the hold will be displayed under the Payments tab in the Seller Hub/My eBay. We will notify you through the eBay Message Center and/or by email and, depending on
                    the reason, may request additional information from you to help resolve the issue. A hold may be placed if we have reason to believe there is an increased risk associated with the provision of our Payment Services or with a certain Managed Payment transaction, for example if we
                    cannot verify your identity or if your buyer files a dispute. Please see our <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/getting-paid/getting-paid-items-youve-sold/pending-payments?id=4816">holds help page</a> for more detail on the hold types and examples. We take into
                    consideration relevant factors when assessing the risks including selling history, seller performance, returns and cancellations, chargebacks, riskiness of the listing category, transaction value, the ability to make direct debits from your Linked Financial Account, and the
                    filing of eBay Buyer Protection Program claims. We also may cancel or freeze the settlement of your proceeds as necessary to comply with our legal obligations in connection with fraud prevention, risk management, or regulatory compliance, or, upon lawful request by our
                    Affiliates, to enable them to comply with legal obligations applicable to them (such as compliance with tax-related obligations from <a href="https://www.ebay.ie/help/selling/selling/dac7-sales-reporting-obligations?id=5394">EU DAC7 legislation</a>). Any hold placed on your funds
                    will be lifted when the issue is resolved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unless your payout entity is eBay Sarl or ECUK, we may retain an amount that we reasonably believe may be necessary to pay for any refunds, reimbursements, or other payments associated with returns, Disputes, or other post-transaction activities, when your eBay account is closed.
                    Unless otherwise required by law, we will settle any unused retained amounts to your Linked Financial Account within 180 days of your eBay account closure.
                  </p>
                  <p>Your bank's holds and settlement procedures may at times cause delays in the settlement of funds to your Linked Financial Account, and we do not have control over these delays.</p>

                  <h4>Reserves</h4>
                  <p>
                    In order to manage risk or secure your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use, we have the right to require a reserve of transaction proceeds. This means that the respective portion of your funds is reserved as unavailable for disbursement. Reserves may be in the form of
                    rolling and/or minimum reserves.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A rolling reserve is a reserve funded by withholding a set percentage of your transaction proceeds each day for a fixed period to be released to you later at a scheduled time on a rolling basis. For example, we may require a rolling reserve of 10% for a period of 60 days. Under
                      this requirement, 10% of your transaction proceeds earned on day 1 will be withheld from your payouts and then be released to you on day 61. Subsequently, 10% of your transaction proceeds earned on day 2 will be withheld and then released to you on day 62, and so forth. Rolling
                      reserves are the most common type of reserve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A minimum reserve is a requirement to hold a specific amount of money in your reserve. A minimum reserve may be funded by contributing a set percentage of your daily transaction proceeds to the reserve up to the minimum requirement, or by setting-off the entire amount of the
                      minimum requirement from your pending payouts. For example, if we require a minimum reserve of $5,000, the reserve may be funded by contributing 10% of your transaction proceeds to the reserve each day until the amount reaches $5,000. Alternatively, if your pending payouts
                      equal or exceed $5,000, the minimum reserve may be funded by setting off the reserve requirement from your pending payouts at one-time in full.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    We may require a reserve if we have reason to believe there is an increased risk of non-fulfillment of your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use. We take into consideration relevant risk factors before requiring a reserve, including, as applicable (i) your eBay account
                    history, (ii) whether the category you are listing in has a higher likelihood of chargebacks or refunds, (iii) whether your eBay account has an elevated number of customer claims or disputes, (iv) your business and/or personal credit history (business sellers may be subject to
                    credit agency checks if permitted by applicable law), (v) whether you are selling products in advance of availability (pre-selling orders), and (vi) whether you have extended delivery time frames. Depending on your performance and the risk associated with your use of Managed
                    Payments, a reserve may be raised, lowered, or removed at any time. The amount of each reserve (and any subsequent change) will be reasonably determined based on the seller-specific risk (including the volume of your sales). The amount and status of each reserve will be displayed
                    under the Payments tab in the Seller Hub/My eBay and we will notify you of any reserves we require of you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If ECA is your Payout Entity, any reserve required of you is further subject to the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com.au/seller-reserves/terms/">Seller Reserve Terms and Conditions</a>. By accepting these Payments Terms of Use, you agree to the
                    <a href="https://pages.ebay.com.au/seller-reserves/terms/">Seller Reserve Terms and Conditions</a> to the extent they apply to you.

                  <p>
                    We may use our Affiliates or third-party service providers (for example companies that process payments and disburse settlements, perform risk assessments or compliance checks, verify identity, or validate payment or settlement methods) in different
                    <a href="https://pages.ebay.co.uk/payment/2.0/outsourcing/">locations</a> to assist us in providing Managed Payments. Our Affiliates or third-party service providers may further outsource the services to other eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers. In this context we
                    may transfer your data to such eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers to whom services are outsourced. At times, we may communicate to you through the eBay Affiliate which provides the eBay Services to you. For example, our Affiliate may notify you of a hold or other
                    restrictions taken on your account. As relating to outsourced services, you hereby explicitly agree to our use of such eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers to assist us in providing Managed Payments and the outsourcing of services in relation thereto (including the
                    right to sub-outsource), and you accept that the obligation of secrecy does not exist with respect to the related transfer of data (e.g. contact details, account information, sales related information) to such eBay Affiliates and third-party service providers. Our Affiliates and
                    third-party service providers are either subject by law to a professional secrecy obligation, as provided by the law applicable to the eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers, or will be contractually bound to comply with strict confidentiality rules. Customer data
                    transferred in accordance with these purposes will only be accessible to a limited number of persons within the relevant eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers, on a need to know basis. Regardless of whether we use eBay Affiliates or third-party service providers, the

                <p>
                  You authorize us to collect from you any amounts you owe us, our Affiliates (in particular the Affiliate which provides the eBay Services to you), or third parties who, as separately authorized by you, provide services to you in connection with your use of the eBay Services (such
                  as shipping carriers), under these Payments Terms of Use, the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259"> User Agreement</a>, any other service contract, policy, agreement or as required by law (referred to as &ldquo;<strong
                    >Owed Amounts</strong
                  >&rdquo;). Owed Amounts typically include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fees;</li>
                  <li>Amounts as described in &ldquo;Returns and Cancellations; Refunds&rdquo;, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fines, Penalties and Losses&rdquo; in Section 7 above;</li>
                  <li>Amounts you owe the eMBG Service Provider under the applicable eMBG Policy;</li>
                  <li>Taxes or other charges related to your use of our or our Affiliates' services, if applicable and required by law; and</li>
                  <li>Amounts we incorrectly settled to you due to a payment processing error or otherwise (see Section 1 above).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For clarity, your authorization permits us to collect amounts which you already owe to us, our Affiliates or third parties as described above. This authorization does not establish any new claims for payment against you. In some cases, our Affiliates may assign a claim against you
                  for payment of Owed Amounts payable by you to us.
                </p>

                <p>Collection of the Owed Amounts may be carried out on a one-time, sporadic, or recurring basis by the following means:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Retaining such amounts from your current or future disbursements relating to any transactions that you may have in connection with any eBay account owned by you;</li>
                  <li>Recouping from your Linked Financial Account (and if required, by issuing a direct debit mandate or other similar authorization);</li>
                  <li>Recouping from any other payment instrument or payment method you may have authorized or placed on file with us or our Affiliates (for example, to pay for seller fees, shipping labels, or dispute resolution);</li>
                  <li>Recouping from your stored value account, if a stored value account has been issued to you;</li>
                  <li>Recouping from your payment account, if a payment account has been issued to you (see Part III); and</li>
                  <li>Retaining collections agencies or using other collections methods, if the collection by other means has been unsuccessful.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You authorize us to choose the method of collection among those listed above. We generally deduct Owed Amounts from your current or future disbursements we process on your behalf. If a stored value account or payment account has been issued to you, we will deduct the Owed Amounts
                  from funds held in the relevant stored value account or payment account before disbursing the funds to you. If your disbursements awaiting payout or funds held are not sufficient to cover these amounts, we will charge your Linked Financial Account or another payment method on file.
                  If you have several payment instruments on file, you may indicate a specific payment instrument as your preferred payment method for collecting Owed Amounts in your eBay account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You also authorize the Affiliate whom you have entered into the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> with for the provision of eBay Services to charge you for any Owed Amounts on our behalf from any payment
                  method you may have on file with such Affiliate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you provide us with a SEPA/BACS direct debit mandate for debiting Owed Amounts from your bank account, any required advance notice will be given to you at least three days prior to charging your bank account. At any point prior to you explicitly cancelling a SEPA/BACS direct
                  debit mandate we have obtained from you, we may deduct Owed Amounts based on such mandate. Unless you are a consumer in the EU or UK, you waive, to the extent possible under applicable law, any rights you may have to receive advance notice of any particular preauthorized charge.
                </p>
                <p>If our attempt to recoup an Owed Amount from a payment instrument you have authorized us to use fails as a result of your acts or omissions, we may charge you for the failed attempt as set forth on the Fee Page or as applicable in Parts IV and V below.</p>

                  anticipated effective date of such change.
                </p>
                <p>The changes offered to you shall only become effective if you accept them as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If a proposed change is a material change (as defined below), we will ask for your active consent to such a change.</li>
                  <li>
                    If a proposed change is not a material change, you will be deemed to have consented to these changes unless you explicitly reject them by notice to us in text form (e.g. via email) before the anticipated effective date. In case of such changes, we will inform you in the notice
                    with which we offer you the changes about the right of rejection, the period of time and your termination right (see subsection below).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  A âmaterial changeâ is a change of these Payments Terms of Use (especially with respect to provisions defining the type and general scope of the agreed services or the term and termination) in our favor, which would significantly shift the balance between service and remuneration
                  to your disadvantage or would effectively establish an entirely new contract.
                </p>
                <p>A change which is due to a requirement of law, a legally binding court decision or an injunction does not constitute a material change.</p>
                <p><strong>Termination right in case of amendments (all sellers)</strong></p>
                <p>
                  If you do not agree to proposed changes, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use, pursuant to Section 11 (&ldquo;Term, Termination&rdquo;) below, without any extra cost at any time before the effective date. We always publish the amended Payments Terms of Use on the eBay
                  website.

                <p>These Payments Terms of Use are effective indefinitely, unless terminated in accordance with the below.</p>
                <p>
                  We may terminate these Payments Terms of Use by giving written notice fourteen (14) days prior or if eBay Sarl or ECUK is your Payout Entity, then two (2) months prior via email to your registered email address. However, we may also terminate these Payments Terms of Use on less
                  notice or with immediate effect in the following scenarios:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We are required to do so by law or a court order,</li>
                  <li>A governmental authority requires us to do so to comply with anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing obligations,</li>
                  <li>We have reasonable grounds to believe you are carrying out a prohibited or illegal activity (including, but not limited to, financial crimes such as fraud, bribery, corruption money laundering, or sanctions violations),</li>
                  <li>We are unable to verify your or your business's identity, or any other information pertaining to you, or</li>
                  <li>You are otherwise in breach of a material contractual obligation of these Payments Terms of Use, or seriously or persistently violating any provisions of these terms in any other way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  If eBay Sarl or ECUK is your Payout Entity, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use and close your payment account, without prejudice to the termination events foreseen above, by giving one (1) month notice by notifying eBay Sarl preferably via email at
                  <a href="mailto:payments@ebay.de">payments@ebay.de</a> or ECUK at <a href="mailto:Paymentsinfouk@ebay.co.uk">Paymentsinfouk@ebay.co.uk</a> or by contacting the Customer Service via any of the available communication methods (e.g. Contact Us form, chat).
                </p>

                <p>If eBay Sarl or ECUK is not your Payout Entity, you may terminate these Payments Terms of Use by closing your eBay account; if you use Managed Payments after such termination, you will be deemed to have again accepted these Payments Terms of Use.</p>
                <p>If you give notice of termination to one eBay Payment Entity, such notice shall also be deemed as a termination notice to the remaining eBay Payment Entities.</p>

                  Your use of the eBay Services as a seller requires continued registration for Managed Payments. Should you therefore terminate this agreement, you will not be able to use the eBay Services provided by our Affiliates. Our Affiliates which provide you the eBay Services according to
                  the User Agreement may terminate the User Agreement pursuant to the termination provisions therein.

                <p>
                  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect the rights or liabilities of either party accrued until termination and/or any terms intended (expressly or implicitly) to survive termination, including your obligation to pay amounts owed to us relating to your activities prior to
                  termination and our right to collect from you such amounts in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use. If there are pending payment transactions at the time the termination takes effect, they will be processed pursuant to terms of these Payments Terms of Use unless prohibited
                  by law. As of the effective date of the termination, you will not be able to sell any items on eBay Services anymore.

                      <strong>eCI will receive payments on your behalf as your agent. You hereby appoint eCI as your agent for the limited purpose of receiving, holding and settling payments for Managed Payments transactions.</strong>

                    <p>
                      A payment received by us from a buyer, on your behalf, satisfies the buyer's obligation to you in the amount of the payment received, regardless of whether we actually settle such payment to you. In the event that we do not make any such payment to you as described in these
                      Payments Terms of Use, you will have recourse against us only and not against the buyer, as such payment is deemed to be made by the buyer to you upon receipt by us. To the extent permissible under the rules of any third-party or governmental body with jurisdiction over us, you
                      agree that we are not liable for your acts and omissions and you understand that we disclaim any such liability.

                    <p>
                      After a Managed Payments transaction occurs, you will receive a notification confirming such payment transaction.
                      <strong
                        >In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, high risk or potential violation of any regulation, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, eBay or eCI policies, or a policy of one of our third-party
                        payments services providers.</strong

                    <p>
                      Funds received by us on your behalf represent an unsecured claim for payment against us, but do not constitute deposits; nor are these amounts eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. eCI may combine your funds with the funds of other eCI customers in pooled custodial accounts
                      and invest the funds in accordance with state money transmitter laws. You do not have any ownership interest in these investments and any interest earned from these investments will be retained by us. To the extent you may have any beneficial ownership in the interest or
                      proceeds of these investments, your acceptance of these terms constitutes an assignment of any right, title or interest therein to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we are your Payout Entity, we will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account. We may, in our sole discretion, offer you the option to receive your proceeds to a stored value account issued to you by us. Your transaction proceeds, other than
                      those being held in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use, and subject to the estimated settlement times set forth in the next sentence, will be aggregated to a batch for settlement to you on a regular basis (for example, a single daily settlement for all transactions
                      ready for disbursement to you that day), unless otherwise requested by you and agreed to by us. We anticipate that Managed Payments transaction proceeds will generally be settled to your Linked Financial Account approximately two to seven business days after the buyer's
                      transaction, although actual settlement times may vary for individual transactions based on circumstances such as your bankâs processing times. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when you onboard to Managed Payments, we may initially place you on a different payout schedule (no
                      less frequently than monthly) and will communicate the applicable payout schedule to you in My eBay or Seller Hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We may diverge from this procedure as needed for compliance or operational reasons. If we are unable to settle the Managed Payments proceeds, then, depending on the reason why we are unable to settle the proceeds, we may refund the buyer or otherwise process these funds in
                      accordance with applicable law, including abandoned property laws, such as by escheating funds to a governmental body after the passage of an applicable period of time, or our policies.

                            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a
                            court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of these Payments Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate,
                            or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The
                            AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. &nbsp;In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute ("Notice"), which may be downloaded at this link:&nbsp;
                            <a href="http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf">http://p.ebaystatic.com/aw/help/legal/Notice_of_Dispute.pdf</a>. The Notice to eCI must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. Any
                            such Notice addressed to and received by eBay will also be deemed to be received by eCI, if such Notice regards services offered by eCI. eCI will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to
                            keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address
                            and phone number associated with your account.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you and eCI are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eCI receives the Notice, you or eCI may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In
                            addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eCI at the following address: eBay Commerce Inc. c/o CT
                            Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eCI initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or
                            eCI shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held,
                            you and/or eCI may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                            different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eCI user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
                            jurisdiction thereof.

                          <h5>Costs of Arbitration</h5>
                          <p>
                            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (âArbitration
                            Proceduresâ) and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eCI will pay all administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eCI should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand
                            for Arbitration and eCI will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eCI for all fees associated with the
                            arbitration paid by eCI on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules. eCI will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration forum from
                            being prohibitive.

                    <h3>1. Payment Service; Disabling Payment Methods</h3>
                    <p>
                      You authorize eBay Sarl to acquire and settle payments that it receives on your behalf. When you sell an item on eBay, you are deemed to be a payee, with eBay Sarl acting as your payment service provider. In a refund, chargeback, or similar scenario, or if you use your funds to
                      pay, you may be deemed to be a payer, again with eBay Sarl acting as your payment service provider. If eBay Sarl is your Payout Entity, eBay Sarl will open and hold a payment account for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The acceptance of a buyer's payment instrument (for example, their Visa card), once it has been authorized for payment, satisfies the buyer's payment obligation to you, regardless of whether we actually settle such payment to you. In the event that we do not make any such
                      payment to you as described in these Payments Terms of Use, you will have recourse against us only and not against the buyer. To the extent permissible under the rules of any third-party or governmental body with jurisdiction over us, you agree that we are not liable for your
                      acts and omissions and you understand that we disclaim any such liability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We may disable specific payment method(s) available to buyers for all or some of your listings if we reasonably believe the use of such payment methods for your transactions will increase regulatory, financial, or other risk to us. For example, if you would like to offer a
                      high-priced item with a new eBay account, we may disable such payment methods where the amount is credited with a time delay after the transaction (e.g. direct debit or payment upon invoice). In assessing the risk, we consider relevant factors such as your sales history,
                      service status, eBay account history, risks associated with certain item categories, transaction value, and number and monetary amounts of eBay Buyer Protection cases. We will re-enable the affected payment method(s) for your listings once the risk no longer exists.

                      <h4>Required Information</h4>
                      <p>
                        Your payer (for example, the buyer of an item you sell on eBay) must ensure we are provided with the data required for us to execute the payment transaction. If we do not have sufficient data to execute such transaction, we reserve the right to ask your payer's payment
                        service provider for the required information.
                      </p>
                      <p>We require the following information for the execution of a payment transaction:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Your name,</li>
                        <li>Your eBay username,</li>
                        <li>The buyer's name (where applicable),</li>
                        <li>The buyer's eBay username, and any other data about the buyer which the buyer's payment service provider or we may require (where applicable),</li>
                        <li>The currency of the payment transaction (if possible, in abbreviated form),</li>
                        <li>The amount of the payment transaction, and</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary's payment details.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We may also require specific information, such as a one-time authorization code sent to your verified phone number or email address, to authenticate a payment transaction (or to allow you to access certain information related to Managed Payments on eBay).</p>
                      <p>
                        To the extent reasonably possible, we will automatically utilize the information stored in our systems. Where the required information provided by you or your payer is not fully available or is inaccurate, we will not bear any liability for any damage, delay, or other
                        consequence from the non-execution or defective execution of the relevant payment transaction.

                      <p>If the payment order is not received on a business day, it will be deemed to be received on the next business day. &ldquo;Business days&rdquo; in this Part III of these Payments Terms of Use shall mean the days on which banks in Luxembourg are open for regular business.</p>
                      <p>You may not revoke a payment order after we have received it. However, if we have agreed that a payment order will be executed on a certain future date, the business day prior to this future date will be the latest you can revoke the payment order.</p>

                      <p>We reserve the right to refuse the execution of a payment order when:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The payment order information contains factual errors and/or is incomplete;</li>
                        <li>You have not satisfied your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use or any other agreement between you and us;</li>
                        <li>There are doubts about the validity of the instruction, or the identity or authority of the person giving the payment order; or</li>
                        <li>The payment order, if executed, would lead to a breach of the applicable rules, laws, or regulations.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We may charge a reasonable fee for such a refusal.</p>
                      <p>
                        You acknowledge that when executing a payment transaction, we may have to disclose information mentioned above and your legal address to the other partyâs payment service provider and, where relevant, also to intermediaries involved in the execution of the payment
                        transaction. You expressly accept and instruct us to disclose such data.
                      </p>
                      <p>Where you are the payer, the execution of the transaction may depend on us having received the respective amount from you prior to the execution.</p>

                    <h3>3. Settlement of Funds</h3>
                    <p>
                      If we are your Payout Entity, we will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account. Your payments will generally be initiated either automatically according to the schedule you have pre-selected or &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; based on an individual
                      payment instruction we receive from you. However, if your payment account is not configured to include a regularly scheduled settlement, we may periodically sweep available funds out of your payment account and send them to your Linked Financial Account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Your transaction proceeds, other than those being held in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use, will be aggregated to a batch for settlement to you according to the payout schedule agreed with you. For example, if you select weekly payouts, a single settlement will be
                      initiated automatically once a week for all transactions ready for disbursement to you on that day. If you request a payout on demand, a single settlement will be initiated for all transactions ready for disbursement to you on that day. You may be able to choose to have only a
                      portion of your available transaction proceeds paid out to your Linked Financial Account, leaving the rest in your payment account. We anticipate that your transaction proceeds will be available on your payment account and ready for disbursement approximately one to two
                      business days after the buyer's completion of the order, although actual availability may vary for individual transactions depending on the buyerâs payment method, and when the payment transaction is received by us. We may diverge from the agreed settlement process as needed
                      for compliance or risk reasons. The balance on your payment account is not a deposit. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money held in your payment account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we are unable to settle your proceeds, then, depending on the reason why we are unable to settle your proceeds, we may refund the buyer (e.g., in the event that we cannot process your information due to technical reasons etc.) or otherwise process these funds in accordance
                      with applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>We will provide you with monthly statements of your transactions free of charge, which can be accessed in the <a href="https://www.ebay.ie/help/selling/selling-tools/seller-hub?id=4095&st=3&pos=1&query=Seller%20Hub">Seller Hub</a>.</p>

                      You will be fully liable for all losses relating to an unauthorized payment transaction if you acted fraudulently with respect to such a payment transaction, or if you failed to fulfill one or more of the obligations under this agreement (such as keeping your credentials safe
                      or notifying us without undue delay) with intent or gross negligence.

                      We will refund you in full and are liable for losses directly and reasonably foreseeably incurred by an incorrectly or non-executed payment transaction, provided that you have informed us of such transaction without undue delay after becoming aware of the defect and in no event
                      later than thirteen (13) months after the transaction was executed, unless we failed to make information about the transaction available to you.

                      <h4>7.1 Specific Payment Methods</h4>
                      <p>
                        7.1.1 On certain European eBay sites, buyers may be able to choose payment methods such as direct debit, payment by invoice or installment payments (&ldquo;Specific Payment Methods&rdquo;) to pay for items purchased from you. The Specific Payment Methods are offered to buyers
                        by our integrated <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/getting-paid/start-getting-paid-ebay?id=4795">payment partners</a> (&ldquo;Payment Partners&rdquo;).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        7.1.2 If your buyer chooses one of the Specific Payment Methods in connection with a purchase on eBay (&ldquo;Sales Contract&rdquo;), eBay Sarl acquires your purchase price claim against the buyer, including all ancillary rights, and will sell and assign the claim to its
                        acquirer (&ldquo;Acquirer&rdquo;), e.g. Adyen N.V. The Acquirer will sell and assign the purchased claim to the respective Payment Partner, who will assume the payment default risk in accordance with the following provisions. This arrangement is further referred to as
                        &ldquo;Chain Factoring&rdquo;. Buyers using a Specific Payment Method will make their payments to the Payment Partner, who will forward the payments to eBay Sarl via the Acquirer, so that eBay Sarl can process and settle such payments according to these Payments Terms of
                        Use.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        7.1.3 You shall conclude with your buyer the Payment Partners&rsquo; terms and conditions for the use of the respective Specific Payment Method, including any applicable privacy notice (&ldquo;Partner Terms&rdquo;). See
                        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/getting-paid/start-getting-paid-ebay?id=4795">here</a> for a list of the Partner Terms for each Specific Payment Method. You hereby agree and accept that the respective Partner Terms shall become an integral part of each Sales
                        Contract where the buyer uses a Specific Payment Method. You instruct eBay and the Payment Partners to implement the Partner Terms into the eBay check-out and make the Partner Terms available to the buyer on your behalf.
                      </p>
                      <p>7.1.4 The Payment Partners and the Acquirer will not be a party to and not have any obligation under these Payments Terms of Use or any other agreement between you and eBay Sarl, eBay, the buyer or any third party.</p>

                      <p>
                        7.2.1 You agree that each receivable against your respective buyer in connection with a Sales Contract where your buyer has chosen a Specific Payment Method and which is nominated in EUR (jointly the âSeller Receivablesâ and each a âSeller Receivableâ) will automatically be
                        offered to eBay Sarl for purchase after conclusion of each Sales Contract. eBay Sarl will either accept your offer by proceeding with the payment process, or reject your offer. Such offer and acceptance will conclude a purchase agreement between you and eBay Sarl (âSingle
                        Purchase Agreementâ) regarding the relevant Seller Receivable which is purchased (the âPurchased Receivableâ) in accordance with this section 7.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        7.2.2 You hereby assign, subject to the conclusion of a Single Purchase Agreement, all your current and future Seller Receivables including ancillary rights (such as rights for any securities, transport and deficiency insurance claims, withdrawal or rescission rights, or
                        other claims against third parties with respect to the relevant Seller Receivable) to eBay Sarl, and eBay Sarl hereby accepts the assignment.

                      <p>
                        7.2.3 Upon conclusion of a Single Purchase Agreement, you and eBay Sarl reiterate the assignment of the relevant receivable identified through the transaction-ID in the purchase offer whereby the purchase offer constitutes an offer to assign the relevant receivable from you
                        to eBay Sarl and the acceptance of purchase offer constitutes an acceptance of this offer by eBay Sarl.
                      </p>
                      <p>7.2.4 In case there is any doubt about the validity of the assignment of the Seller Receivables and this requires any further declaration or action by you, you will execute such declaration or action upon request of eBay Sarl.</p>
                      <p>
                        7.2.5 You irrevocably authorize eBay Sarl with the power of sub-delegation to notify the relevant buyer regarding the assignment of the Seller Receivable and to exercise non-assignable rights, such as contractual rights, in connection with the Seller Receivables in its own
                        name.

                        purchase price (minus the agreed fees and expenses of eBay Sarl) for the relevant Purchased Receivable regardless of whether it chooses to enforce the relevant Purchased Receivable.

                      <p>7.3.2 The collection and enforcement of the Purchased Receivables is the responsibility of eBay Sarl. eBay Sarl shall bear any and all costs in this regard.</p>

                      <ol type="i">
                        <li>the Purchased Receivable is valid, validly assigned to eBay Sarl and enforceable against the buyer;</li>
                        <li>you hold free and clear title to, and may freely assign and transfer, the Purchased Receivable, and the Purchased Receivable has not yet been assigned or transferred to third parties; and</li>
                        <li>
                          you will ship, deliver or provide the respective item(s) to the relevant buyer completely, on time and in accordance with the Sales Contract with the respective buyer in order that the respective buyer is not able to exercise any right or claim of retention, set-off,
                          supplementary performance, reduction, recession right or damage claims.
                        </li>

                      <p>7.4.2 Each of these representations and warranties to eBay Sarl with respect to a Single Purchase Agreement will be provided by eBay Sarl to the Acquirer (and by the Acquirer to the Payment Partners) back-to-back in accordance with the Chain Factoring arrangement.</p>

                        <li>the buyer reverses the Sales Contract on the basis of a mandatory withdrawal right or a voluntary right of return offered by you;</li>
                        <li>
                          in case of an eMBG claim or a payment dispute; for example, if the buyer objects to a Purchased Receivable, if - upon request of eBay Sarl - you do not provide valid proof of shipment or delivery or other proper performance to eBay Sarl in accordance with the
                          <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-protections?id=4345">Seller Protection Policy</a>;

                        or in any other case where you give a refund to a buyer for any Purchased Receivable (&ldquo;Refunded Receivable&rdquo;), and the Acquirer consequently decides to use its right to assign back the relevant Defect/Refunded Receivable to eBay Sarl, eBay Sarl is entitled to

                        to pay to eBay Sarl with any further payment which eBay Sarl is obliged to pay to you.

                        These Payments Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. If you are acting as a consumer (rather than as a business) and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence

                        Luxembourg. If eBay Sarl wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business seller, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
                        the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

                    <p>
                      After a Managed Payments transaction occurs, you will receive a notification confirming such payment transaction.
                      <strong>In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, high risk or potential violation of any eBay or ECCA policies, or a policy of one of our third-party payments services providers.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Funds received by us on your behalf represent an unsecured claim for payment against us, but do not constitute deposits. ECCA may combine your funds with the funds of other ECCA customers in pooled custodial accounts and invest the funds in accordance with applicable law. You
                      do not have any ownership interest in these investments and any interest earned from these investments will be retained by us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we are your Payout Entity, we will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account. Your transaction proceeds, other than those being held in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use, and subject to the estimated settlement times set forth in the
                      next sentence, will be aggregated to a batch for settlement to you on a regular basis (for example, a single daily settlement for all transactions ready for disbursement to you that day), unless otherwise requested by you and agreed to by us. We anticipate that Managed Payments
                      transactions proceeds will generally be settled in your Linked Financial Account approximately two to seven business days after the buyer's transaction, although actual settlement times may vary for individual transactions based on circumstances such as your bank's processing
                      times. However, we may diverge from this procedure as needed for compliance or operational reasons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when you onboard to Managed Payments, we may initially place you on a different payout schedule (no less frequently than monthly) and will
                      communicate the applicable payout schedule to you in My eBay or Seller Hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we are unable to settle your proceeds, then, depending on the reason why we are unable to settle your proceeds, we may refund the buyer (e.g., in the event that we cannot process your information for technical reasons or you violate these Payments Terms of Use, etc.) or
                      otherwise process these funds in accordance with applicable law or policies.

                    <p>
                      The authorization to pay for Owed Amounts in accordance with Part I, Section 9 is an electronic pre-authorized debit agreement (&ldquo;<strong>PAD Agreement</strong>&rdquo;) that you are entering into for business purposes to allow eBay to debit your designated bank account,
                      and is subject to the rules of Payments Canada.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By completing registration for Managed Payments, you hereby authorize ECCA (or its Affiliates) and the ï¬nancial institution that has issued your Linked Financial Account to debit your Linked Financial Account for Owed Amounts in variable amounts at such intervals as when you
                      have Owed Amounts that are due and owing and we are unable to collect such Owed Amounts from your current or future disbursements.
                    </p>

                      <strong
                        >You agree to waive all pre-notification requirements under the Payments Canada rules in respect of any variable debits originated under this PAD Agreement. ECCA&nbsp;will notify you by email regarding any one-time or sporadic debits in order to obtain your
                        authorization.</strong

                    <p>
                      ECCA, or its Affiliates, will charge your account a CDN$ 7.00 fee by way of a separate debit for each and every debit transaction authorized above that is unsuccessful or returned unpaid by your ï¬nancial institution. We shall have no liability to you whatsoever caused by a
                      dishonored debit.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you would like to cancel this PAD Agreement, you may do so at any time by contacting ECCA. If you cancel this PAD Agreement without providing a new authorization, we may suspend or cancel your Payment Services and eBay may suspend or cancel your eBay Services.</p>
                    <p>
                      You have certain recourse rights if any debit does not comply with this PAD Agreement. For example, you have the right to receive reimbursement for any debit that is not authorized or is not consistent with this PAD Agreement. To obtain more information on your recourse rights,
                      or for further information on your right to cancel this PAD Agreement and applicable forms, you may contact your ï¬nancial institution or visit www.payments.ca.

Your transaction proceeds, other than those being held in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use, and subject to the estimated settlement times set forth in the

                      high-priced item with a new eBay account, we may disable such payment methods where the amount is credited with a time delay after the transaction (e.g. Buy Now Pay Later). In assessing the risk, we consider relevant factors such as your sales history, service status, eBay
                      account history, risks associated with certain item categories, transaction value, and number and monetary amounts of eBay Buyer Protection cases. We will re-enable the affected payment method(s) for your listings once the risk no longer exists.

                    <h3>1. Payment Service; Disabling Payment Methods</h3>
                    <p>
                      You authorize ECUK to acquire and settle payments that it receives on your behalf. When you sell an item on eBay, you are deemed to be a payee, with ECUK acting as your payment service provider. In a refund, chargeback, or similar scenario, or if you use your funds to pay, you
                      may be deemed to be a payer, again with ECUK acting as your payment service provider. If ECUK is your Payout Entity, ECUK will open and hold a payment account for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The acceptance of a buyer's payment instrument (for example, their Visa card), once it has been authorized for payment, satisfies the buyer's payment obligation to you, regardless of whether we actually settle such payment to you. In the event that we do not make any such
                      payment to you as described in these Payments Terms of Use, you will have recourse against us only and not against the buyer. To the extent permissible under the rules of any third-party or governmental body with jurisdiction over us, you agree that we are not liable for your
                      acts and omissions and you understand that we disclaim any such liability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We may disable specific payment method(s) available to buyers for all or some of your listings if we reasonably believe the use of such payment methods for your transactions will increase regulatory, financial, or other risk to us. For example, if you would like to offer a
                      high-priced item with a new eBay account, we may disable such payment methods where the amount is credited with a time delay after the transaction (e.g. direct debit or payment upon invoice). In assessing the risk, we consider relevant factors such as your sales history,
                      service status, eBay account history, risks associated with certain item categories, transaction value, and number and monetary amounts of eBay Buyer Protection cases. We will re-enable the affected payment method(s) for your listings once the risk no longer exists.

                    <h3>2. Execution of Payment Transactions</h3>
                    <p>When you, as a payee or payer, use Managed Payments, the payment transactions will be executed in accordance with the payment schemes rules and procedures, or as otherwise agreed.</p>
                    <article>
                      <h4>Required Information</h4>
                      <p>
                        Your payer (for example, the buyer of an item you sell on eBay) must ensure we are provided with the data required for us to execute the payment transaction. If we do not have sufficient data to execute such transaction, we reserve the right to ask your payer's payment
                        service provider for the required information.
                      </p>
                      <p>We require the following information for the execution of a payment transaction:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Your name,</li>
                        <li>Your eBay username,</li>
                        <li>The buyer's name (where applicable),</li>
                        <li>The buyer's eBay username, and any other data about the buyer which the buyer's payment service provider or we may require (where applicable),</li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The currency of the payment transaction (if possible, in abbreviated form),</li>
                        <li>The amount of the payment transaction, and</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary's payment details.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We may also require specific information, such as a one-time authorization code sent to your verified phone number or email address, to authenticate a payment transaction (or to allow you to access certain information related to Managed Payments on eBay).</p>
                      <p>
                        To the extent reasonably possible, we will automatically utilize the information stored in our systems. Where the required information provided by you or your payer is not fully available or is inaccurate, we will not bear any liability for any damage, delay, or other
                        consequence from the non-execution or defective execution of the relevant payment transaction.

                      <h4>Receipt of Payment Orders</h4>
                      <p>A payment order will be deemed to have been received by us if:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Carried out by means of a payment card, then in accordance with the card schemes rules; or</li>
                        <li>Received by our available electronic communication channels, then on the business day when it is actually received by us.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>If the payment order is not received on a business day, it will be deemed to be received on the next business day. &ldquo;Business days&rdquo; in this Part III of these Payments Terms of Use shall mean the days on which banks in London are open for regular business.</p>
                      <p>You may not revoke a payment order after we have received it. However, if we have agreed that a payment order will be executed on a certain future date, the business day prior to this future date will be the latest you can revoke the payment order.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                      <h4>Refusal of Payment Orders</h4>
                      <p>We reserve the right to refuse the execution of a payment order when:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The payment order information contains factual errors and/or is incomplete;</li>
                      </ul>
                      <ul>
                        <li>You have not satisfied your obligations under these Payments Terms of Use or any other agreement between you and us;</li>
                        <li>There are doubts about the validity of the instruction, or the identity or authority of the person giving the payment order; or</li>
                        <li>The payment order, if executed, would lead to a breach of the applicable rules, laws, or regulations.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We may charge a reasonable fee for such a refusal.</p>
                      <p>
                        You acknowledge that when executing a payment transaction, we may have to disclose information mentioned above and your legal address to the other partyâs payment service provider and, where relevant, also to intermediaries involved in the execution of the payment
                        transaction. You expressly accept and instruct us to disclose such data.
                      </p>
                      <p>Where you are the payer, the execution of the transaction may depend on us having received the respective amount from you prior to the execution.</p>

                    <h3>3. Settlement of Funds</h3>
                    <p>
                      If we are your Payout Entity, we will initiate settlement of proceeds received to your Linked Financial Account. Your payments will generally be initiated either automatically according to the schedule you have pre-selected or &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; based on an individual
                      payment instruction we receive from you. However, if your payment account is not configured to include a regularly scheduled settlement, we may periodically sweep available funds out of your payment account and send them to your Linked Financial Account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Your transaction proceeds, other than those being held in accordance with these Payments Terms of Use, will be aggregated to a batch for settlement to you according to the payout schedule agreed with you. For example, if you select weekly payouts, a single settlement will be
                      initiated automatically once a week for all transactions ready for disbursement to you on that day. If you request a payout on demand, a single settlement will be initiated for all transactions ready for disbursement to you on that day. You may be able to choose to have only a
                      portion of your available transaction proceeds paid out to your Linked Financial Account, leaving the rest in your payment account. We anticipate that your transaction proceeds will be available on your payment account and ready for disbursement approximately one to two
                      business days after the buyer's completion of the order, although actual availability may vary for individual transactions depending on the buyerâs payment method, and when the payment transaction is received by us. We may diverge from the settlement process as needed for
                      compliance or risk reasons. The balance on your payment account is not a deposit. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money held in your payment account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If we are unable to settle your proceeds, then, depending on the reason why we are unable to settle your proceeds, we may refund the buyer (e.g., in the event that we cannot process your information due to technical reasons etc.) or otherwise process these funds in accordance
                      with applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>We will provide you with monthly statements of your transactions free of charge, which can be accessed in the <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sh/landing">Seller Hub</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                      You will be fully liable for all losses relating to an unauthorized payment transaction if you acted fraudulently with respect to such a payment transaction, or if you failed to fulfill one or more of the obligations under this agreement (such as keeping your credentials safe
                      or notifying us without undue delay) with intent or gross negligence.

                    <h3>5. Our Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                      We will refund you in full and are liable for losses directly and reasonably foreseeably incurred by an incorrectly or non-executed payment transaction, provided that you have informed us of such transaction without undue delay after becoming aware of the defect and in no event
                      later than thirteen (13) months after the transaction was executed, unless we failed to make information about the transaction available to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we and our Affiliates (and our and their respective employees, directors, agents and representatives) will not be liable for any direct lost profits, any indirect lost profits, or any special, incidental or consequential
                      damages (including without limitation damages for loss of data or loss of business) arising out of or in connection with these Payments Terms of Use or Managed Payments (including the inability to use Managed Payments). In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
                      law, in no event will aggregate liability of us or our Affiliates (and our and their respective employees, directors, agents and representatives) arising out of or in connection with these Payments Terms of Use, the transactions contemplated hereby, or Managed Payments exceed
                      the actual amount of direct damages (excluding direct loss of profits), whether in contract, tort (including negligence, product liability or other theory), warranty, or otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will we or any of our Affiliates be liable to you for any failure or delay by us (or our employees, agents, or representatives) in performing our obligations under these Payments Terms of Use, where such failure or delay is caused by
                      abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary, or where we are bound by other legal obligations covered by applicable law.

                    <p>
                      If buyers purchase a return shipping label at their own expense on the eBay website, eBay may automatically deduct the label costs from the refund amount a buyer receives from you. If this occurs, you agree (as a debtor to the buyer for the refund) to be delegated as a debtor
                      to the shipping carrier for the label costs, and authorize us to use the relevant part of the refund amount to pay the shipping carrier on your behalf. You will not bear any additional shipping costs in this event.

                      <p>
                        These Payments Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. If you are acting as a consumer (rather than as a business) and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence contain
                        provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of English law.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As a consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to the General Payments Terms and these Additional Payments Terms for Payment Services provided by ECUK before the competent court of either your place of residence or ECUK's place of business in the United
                        Kingdom. If ECUK wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business seller, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
