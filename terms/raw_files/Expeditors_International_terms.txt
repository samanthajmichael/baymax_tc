                                    <p>"Cookies" are small text files that are stored on your PC or mobile device when you visit Expeditors websites. We use them to:</p>

                                        <li>Tailor our sites to your interests</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>Where do cookies come from?</h5>
                                    <p>There are two sources of cookies:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>First party cookies are sent by us to your device. They can be used to remember your preferences when you visit our websites or to maintain your browser connection. In addition, we might use a separate company to
                                            analyze how people are using our websites. And this separate company will set their own cookie to do this.</li>
                                        <li>Third-party cookies are sent by a third-party that provides functionality through our websites, such as video clips. This helps the third-party to remember your preferences when you visit our websites. Expeditors
                                            has no control over third party cookies.</li>

                                        <li>Persistent cookies are saved on your computer so, they are not deleted when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies when we need to know who you are for more than one browsing session. For example, we
                                            use them to remember your preferences for the next time you visit.</li>

                                    <h5>Cookie Types</h5>
