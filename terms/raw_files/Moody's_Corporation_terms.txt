<p> </p>
<p>9. <u>Disclosures</u>. MIS hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MIS have, prior to assignment of any credit rating, agreed to pay to MIS for credit ratings opinions and services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,000 to approximately $2,700,000. Moody&#39;s Corporation (“MCO”) and its wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary, MIS and its ratings affiliates, also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of the ratings and rating processes of MIS and its ratings affiliates. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and/or its ratings affiliates and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at <a href="https://www.moodys.com/">www.moodys.com</a> under the heading &#34;Investor Relations -- Corporate Governance -- Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.&#34;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10. <u>DISCLAIMERS</u>. Moody’s obtains all Materials furnished on the Site from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. You expressly agree that the credit ratings and other opinions provided via the Site (a) are, and will be construed solely as, statements of opinion of the relative future credit risk (as defined below) of entities, credit commitments, or debt or debt-like securities and not statements of current or historical fact as to credit worthiness, investment or financial advice, recommendations regarding credit decisions or decisions to purchase, hold or sell any securities, endorsements of the accuracy of any of the data or conclusions, or attempts to independently assess or vouch for the financial condition of any company; (b) do not address any other risk, including but not limited to liquidity risk, market value risk or price volatility; (c) do not take into account your personal objectives, financial situations or needs; and (d) will be weighed, if at all, solely as one factor in any investment or credit decision made by or on behalf of you. Accordingly, you further expressly agree that you will with due care, make your own study and evaluation of each investment decision or security, and of each issuer and guarantor of, and each provider of credit support for, each security or credit that you may consider purchasing, holding, selling, or providing. For the avoidance of doubt, Moody’s Materials and opinions may also include quantitative model-based estimates of credit risk and related opinions or commentary published by MA. Further, you expressly agree that any tools or information made available on the Site are not a substitute for the exercise of independent judgment and expertise. You should always seek the assistance of a professional for advice on investments, tax, the law, or other professional matters. For purposes of this paragraph, Moody’s defines “credit risk” as the risk that an entity may not meet its contractual, financial obligations as they come due and any estimated financial loss in the event of default or impairment. See Moody’s Ratings Symbols and Definitions publication for information on the types of contractual financial obligations addressed by Moody’s ratings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moody’s adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources Moody’s considers to be reliable, including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, Moody’s is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing Moody’s Materials made available on the Site. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, the Site and all related Materials are provided on an &#34;AS IS&#34; and “AS AVAILABLE” basis without representation or warranty of any kind, and THE MOODY&#39;S PARTIES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY AS TO THE ACCURACY, RESULTS, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OR ANY RELATED MATERIALS.

<p> </p>
<p>16. <u>Dispute Resolution</u>. <b>THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS THAT WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A COURT HEARING OR JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY.</b> Moody’s is reachable via the contact information at the end of these Terms to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Sites. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to you initiating a lawsuit or arbitration against Moody’s. Any matter or dispute relating in any way to your use of the Sites or these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided below. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, including any disputes relating to the Materials on Site, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise, shall be finally resolved by arbitration if not settled after pre-dispute consultation as described above, and subject to Moody’s right to seek injunctive relief in court as provided below. Any claim must be brought in the claimant’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”), except in the event that five (5) or more individuals seek to initiate (or do initiate) arbitration proceedings against Moody’s in a coordinated or related manner (e.g., coordination among plaintiffs or their counsel in regard to similar claims), then Moody’s may elect in its discretion to consolidate such arbitrations before a single arbitrator and otherwise in accordance with the arbitration provisions herein. The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator in English and in accordance with the International Rules of the American Arbitration Association, which shall administer the arbitration and act as appointing authority. The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York. The decision of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the parties hereto, and the expense of the arbitration (including without limitation the award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party) shall be paid as the arbitrators determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you bring a claim subject to arbitration, Moody’s, if so requested by you, will pay the cost of fees and deposits imposed upon you by the American Arbitration Association or other arbitrator to the extent that such cost exceeds the amount you would have had to pay as filing fees and initial court costs if you had filed suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in New York for the purposes of any judicial proceedings to obtain interim relief and in aid of the arbitration or judicial proceedings to confirm or enforce the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moody’s may seek preliminary injunctive relief from a court of law in the event of a breach by you of these Terms of Use. You expressly waive your right to a trial by jury.</p>

<p>28. <u>Additional Terms for Japan only</u>. Moody&#39;s Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody&#39;s Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings.

MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any credit rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for credit ratings opinions and services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY125,000 to approximately JPY250,000,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.</p>
