This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication or as a substitute for proper medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is for reference only and should not be used to determine treatment for specific medical conditions. You should never disregard, avoid or delay obtaining medical advice from a licensed practitioner because of information made available through the Service. The Service and its health related information and resources are not intended and must not be taken as the rendering of medical, nursing, or professional health care advice or services, or the practice of medicine, nursing, or professional health care in any jurisdiction.

<br />
You understand and agree that neither CVS nor its suppliers or vendors are responsible for any claim, loss, or damage directly or indirectly resulting from your use of the Service or the information resources contained on or accessible through the Service.<br />
<br />
Proper treatment of health conditions depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your medical history, diet, lifestyle, and medication regimen. Your health care provider can best assess and address your individual health care needs. You should consult with your health care provider before starting a new diet, fitness, or supplement regimen.<br />

<p>For purposes of this Agreement, “Materials” includes user IDs, email addresses, passwords, comments, photographs, images, graphics, text, and data, and any other forms of materials or information submitted by Service users through or otherwise in connection with the Service, regardless of whether such information is posted publicly or with password protection.<br />
<br />
The Service is not designed or intended to be used as a disaster recovery or emergency data storage facility and you are responsible for creating and maintaining copies of your Materials prior to posting, uploading, or otherwise submitting such Materials through the Service.<br />
<br />
CVS and its suppliers and vendors have no obligation of any kind with respect to Materials and are not required to assess or otherwise determine the validity or legitimacy of any complaints or demands that they may receive regarding any Materials that you may use or allow others to use in connection with the Service (including Materials posted or submitted to the Service) before CVS and its suppliers and vendors take any remedial action that they consider, in their sole discretion, to be appropriate.<br />
<br />
NEITHER CVS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS CONTROL THE MATERIALS POSTED OR SUBMITTED TO THE SERVICE, NOR DO WE OR THEY HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO (A) MONITOR, SCREEN, POLICE, EDIT, OR ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THOSE MATERIALS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR THIS AGREEMENT, OR (B) EVALUATE THOSE MATERIALS FOR INDICATIONS OF A NEED FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION OR PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE IN RESPONSE. YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE MATERIALS POSTED BY OTHER USERS TO BE OFFENSIVE, HARMFUL, INACCURATE, OR DECEPTIVE. YOU SHOULD USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE WHEN USING THE SERVICE. IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
<p>Although CVS reserves the right to correct any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies, we do not accept any responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, currency, or completeness of any information, content, materials, services, products, merchandise, functionality, or other resources (collectively, “Resources”) available on or accessible through the Service (even typographical or imaging errors), including the substance, accuracy, or sufficiency of any service or product information listed on the Service. Further, we do not represent that the Service will operate without interruption or error, nor do we provide any assurances of the availability or usability of the shopping services offered through the Service.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Your use of (including any access to) the Service and any other Internet sites, including any Resources contained on, or otherwise made available by, them, is solely at your own risk.<br />
 </strong><br />
CVS and its suppliers and vendors will attempt to keep the information, services, and resources accessible through the Service timely and accurate, but make no guarantees, and disclaim any implied warranty or representation about, the Resources or the Service, or any Resource’s or the Service’s accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, reliability, security, or appropriateness for a particular purpose.<br />
<br />
CVS AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, FUNCTIONALITY, AND ANY OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ALL SUCH INFORMATION, CONTENT, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, FUNCTIONALITY, AND OTHER RESOURCES ARE MADE AVAILABLE “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.<br />

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CVS OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, VENDORS, LICENSORS, CO-BRANDERS, OR PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY, “CVS PARTIES”) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LITIGATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE, OPERATION, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, ANY DEFECTS IN THE SERVICE, OR WITH THE PROVISION OF, OR FAILURE TO MAKE AVAILABLE, ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, MATERIALS, OR OTHER RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />

<br />
THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE MAY BE AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS BEYOND CVS’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ OR VENDORS’ CONTROL. THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BY CVS, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR ITS VENDORS, MAY NOT BE SECURE. SECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS CANNOT BE ELIMINATED. PASSWORD PROTECTION AND ANY OTHER SECURITY MEASURES MAY NOT PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO MATERIALS.<br />

<br />
ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE CVS PARTIES, IN THE AGGREGATE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU SOLELY FOR THE RIGHT TO USE THE PARTICULAR INFORMATION OR SERVICE PROVIDED BY CVS HEREUNDER OR $25, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.<br />
<br />
You acknowledge and agree that the limitations set forth above are fundamental elements of this Agreement and the Service would not be provided to you absent such limitations.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Indemnification</h2>
<p>You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the CVS Parties harmless from any liability, loss, claim, and expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to or arising out of your use of the content on the Service, or any Materials that you submit, post, or transmit through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Changes to the Service</h2>
<p>CVS and its suppliers and vendors may change or modify the information, services, products, materials, and any other Resources contained on or accessible through the Service, may charge, modify, or waive any fees required to use the Service (including any portion thereof), or discontinue the Service altogether, at any time without notice.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Your Obligations</h2>
<p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. You agree not to interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Service in any way. Any conduct by you that, in our sole discretion, restricts, inhibits, or interferes with the ability of any other user to enjoy the Service (including by means of hacking or defacing any portion of the Service, or by engaging in spamming, flooding, or other disruptive activities, including with respect to the servers or networks used to make the Service available) will not be tolerated. You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Service (including in connection with any Materials) any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your use of (including any access to) the Service, or parts of the Service, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that it is in violation of this Agreement, our requirements, or any applicable law, or it is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another user or any other third party, including any of our partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants.<br />
<br />
You must not post, transmit, or otherwise make available through or in connection with the Service any virus or other computer code, file, or program that is potentially harmful or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of, any hardware, software, or equipment.<br />
<br />
You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information in connection with the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain and promptly update this account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without notice and refuse any and all current and future use of the Service. Because any termination of your access to the Service may be effected without prior notice, you acknowledge and agree that we may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and bar any further access to such files or the Service. Furthermore, you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to your account or the Service.<br />
<br />
You may be asked to supply a user ID and password and other information to register to use all or part of the Service. We may refuse to grant you a user ID that impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, is or may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights law, is vulgar or otherwise offensive, or may cause confusion, as determined by us in our sole discretion. For security reasons, user IDs and passwords must be non-obvious, hard-to-guess, confidential, and changed on a regular basis, and you must log out at the end of each session. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and password and are fully responsible for all activities (including purchases, as applicable) that occur in connection with your user ID or password such that, for all purposes under this Agreement, any activities in connection with your user ID or password will be deemed to be your activities. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of either your user ID or password or any other breach of security. You further agree that you will not permit others, including those whose accounts have been terminated, to access the Service using your user ID or password. All user IDs and passwords remain the property of CVS, and may be cancelled or suspended at any time by CVS without any prior notice or any liability to you or any other person. CVS is not under any obligation to verify the actual identity or authority of the user of any user ID or password. If CVS, in its sole discretion, considers a password to be insecure, then CVS may cancel the password.<br />
<br />
You must respond promptly to all email and other correspondence from CVS, including without limitation email and correspondence concerning complaints or concerns regarding your use of the Service and the use of your account.<br />
<br />

<br />
When participating in surveys, contests, or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) offered through the Service, you are urged to review the official rules and regulations governing those Promotions (if applicable) and the Privacy Policy.

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by either party. If you no longer agree to be bound by this Agreement, you must cease your use of the Service, including any access thereto.

If you are dissatisfied with the Service, its content, or any of the terms, conditions, and policies of this Agreement, your sole and exclusive legal remedy is to discontinue using the Service.<br />
<br />
If you breach any provision of this Agreement, then you may no longer use the Service.<br />

<br />

<br />
</p>
<h2>Third Party Resources</h2>
<p>The Service may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party sites, services, products, information, content, materials, merchandise, functionality, and/or other resources (“Third Party Resources”). These links and access are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such Third Party Resources and, therefore, we are not responsible for such Third Party Resources, or any content posted on or made available by such Third Party Resources. Be aware that CVS does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about such Third Party Resources, including without limitation the security of any Materials, or the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on or made available by such Third Party Resources or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links or such access at any time. The fact that the Service includes such links or access should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of such Third Party Resources, or any content made available thereby. Because some Third Party Resources employ automated search results or otherwise link you to Third Party Resources containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or made available by Third Party Resources, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such Third Party Resources. Your use of any Third Party Resources is at your own risk and is subject to any additional terms, conditions, and policies applicable to such Third Party Resources (such as Terms of Service or Privacy Policies of the providers of such Third Party Resources).<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement, your use of the Service, and all related matters, regardless of your location, are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws. This Agreement will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT CVS AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (currently available at https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424), as amended by this Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, CVS will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief, or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.<br />
<br />
With the exception of any of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions, if a court decides that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Dispute Resolution provision shall still apply. If a court decides that any aspect of the language above in this Dispute Resolution provision relating to the waiver of class and representative actions is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution provision shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply and be unaffected by this severability provision.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Copyright Infringement Claims: Notice and Take-Down Procedures</h2>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Service infringe your rights under U.S. copyright law, you (or your agent) may send to CVS a written notice by mail, e-mail, or fax, requesting that CVS remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to CVS a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing and meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details), which, with respect to notices of infringement, currently include, among other requirements, the following:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sufficient information identifying the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.</li>
<li>Sufficient information identifying the allegedly infringing material(s) and the location of such material(s) in order to permit CVS to locate such material(s).</li>
<li>A statement from the owner (or the owner’s authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed that such owner or authorized representative has a good faith belief that the allegedly infringing materials are used in a manner not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
<li>Contact information for the complaining party, including a mailing address, a telephone number, and, if available, an email address.</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.</li>
<li>A signature or the electronic equivalent from the owner (or the owner’s authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.</li>

<h2>Forward-Looking Statements</h2>
<p>The Service may contain or make available forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, CVS and its subsidiaries (collectively, “CVS Group”), and its and their representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in CVS’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in the CVS Group’s reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings, and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “will,” “should,” and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS or any subsidiary, events, or developments that the CVS Group expects or anticipates will occur in the future, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The CVS Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in CVS’s SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of CVS’s current Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that CVS has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to CVS or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the CVS Group. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the CVS Group’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the CVS Group’s forward-looking statements.<br />
<br />

If alerted to allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive content, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such content from the Service.<br />

We may limit the availability of the Service at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction that we choose.<br />
<br />
Our failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as an implicit waiver of any provision or right.<br />
<br />
If any part of this Agreement is ruled to be unenforceable, then such part shall be severed, with the remainder of the Agreement remaining in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CVS governing your use of the Service.

The Service may contain or make available forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries, including CVS (collectively, “CVS Group”), and its and their representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in CVS Health Corporation’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in the CVS Group’s reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “will,” “should” and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Health Corporation or any subsidiary, events or developments that the CVS Group expects or anticipates will occur in the future, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The CVS Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in CVS Health Corporation’s SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of CVS Health Corporation’s current Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that CVS Health Corporation has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to CVS Health Corporation or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the CVS Group. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the CVS Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the CVS Group’s forward-looking statements.<br />
