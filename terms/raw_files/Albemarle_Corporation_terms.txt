8. Governing Law and Venue
 

These Terms shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the substantive and procedural laws of the State of North Carolina, including its statute of limitations, to be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), applicable Federal Law, and the laws of North Carolina, and without regard to any conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. You consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in and for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for all disputes. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. You expressly agree that all disputes arising under or relating to the Site or these Terms shall be brought and resolved solely and exclusively in the State of North Carolina. MOREOVER, IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT, ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT ACTION SHALL BE TRIED TO A JUDGE AND NOT A JURY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF EITHER YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER EITHER BY ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, AS APPLICABLE, THEN THE PARTY MUST INITIATE SUCH ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER ACCRUAL OF THE DISPUTE – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

 

9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: MANDATORY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION WAIVER
 

(a) Dispute Resolution. In the unlikely event that a claim or controversy at law or equity (collectively, a “Dispute”) arises between you and Albemarle, prior to initiating any lawsuit, you must first contact Albemarle at legal.notices@albemarle.com so that we may work in good faith to find a mutually agreeable solution within sixty (60) days. You agree that the term “Dispute” in these Terms will have the broadest meaning possible. These Terms also cover any Dispute between you and any officer, director, board member, agent, employee, affiliate of Albemarle, or third party of Albemarle could be liable, directly or indirectly, for such Dispute. 

 

(b) Arbitration. If the Dispute cannot be resolved within sixty (60) days, you agree that it shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, if your claims qualify. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its then applicable rules. All of the AAA’s rules are available at ;www.adr.org, and the rules governing commercial disputes are available at www.adr.org/commercial. The AAA’s rules, including the rules governing commercial disputes, are also available by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may initiate arbitration by utilizing the forms available on www.adr.org. If you have any difficulty initiating arbitration, you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. You and Albemarle are each giving up the right to have Disputes resolved in court before a judge and/or jury (except as stated otherwise in this Section 9). The provisions of this Section 9 constitute your and Albemarle’s written agreement for resolving Disputes, including the agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the FAA (“Dispute Agreement”). The most current version of this Dispute Agreement in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA’s applicable rules. The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of these Terms and the Dispute Agreement.

If you are a business of the United States, arbitration shall take place in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. You and Albemarle further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

 

(c) No Class Action Matters. You and Albemarle each agree that resolution of any Disputes, whether in court or in arbitration, will be conducted and resolved only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, and that any relief awarded, including equitable relief, shall only be awarded on an individual basis.

 

(d) Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you or Albemarle may bring suit in court to seek an injunction, a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief arising out of, or relating to, but not limited to, intellectual property rights or any intentional, illegal act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or security of the Site, and the Restrictions section of these Terms.

 

(d) Severability. With the exception of Section 9(d), if any part of this Section 9 is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then the remaining provisions of Section 9 shall remain in force as if any portion ruled unenforceable were not included in this Section 9. If Section 9(d) is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then Section 9(b) shall no longer be enforceable, but the remainder of this Section 9 shall remain in effect.

 

10. General
 

(a) Sale Agreements. You and Albemarle may have entered into one or more pre-existing written agreements related to your purchase or products and/or services from Albemarle (“Sale Agreements”).
