RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH AES - ARBITRATION
BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY & COOKIES POLICY OR RELATING TO THE SITE THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AS SET FORTH BELOW.

WAIVER.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, YOU MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AGAINST AES IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN ONE OR MORE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR PROCEEDING.

In the event a court determines that the foregoing is unenforceable, then such claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court, subject to AES’ right to appeal.

Good Faith Discussions. You and AES must first attempt to resolve any dispute by good faith discussions or email. If the parties cannot resolve a dispute with good faith discussions, then such dispute shall be resolved solely by binding arbitration as set forth in these Terms.

Rules. You and AES agree that arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules, then in effect and as amended herein (the “Rules”). The Rules can be found at:  https://www.adr.org/Rules. You and AES agree that this agreement to arbitrate involves a transaction of interstate commerce and therefore the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.

Initiating a Claim. The party initiating arbitration must provide the other party a Demand for Arbitration in accordance with the Rules. Any Demand for Arbitration shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the other party and the AAA. The dispute shall be heard by three (3) neutral arbitrators, who shall be selected as follows:  (a) the party initiating the arbitration shall nominate an arbitrator in its demand for arbitration; (b) the responding party shall nominate an arbitrator within 15 days of its receipt of the demand for arbitration; (c) within 15 days of the appointment of the two arbitrators by the AAA (which period may be extended upon agreement of the parties), the two arbitrators shall jointly nominate the third arbitrator, who shall serve as the chair of the arbitration.  If the two party-nominated arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment of the chair within the designated period, the AAA shall appoint the chair in accordance with the Rules.

Arbitrator. The arbitrators shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes arising under these Terms or with regard to the Site or Content, including as to the enforceability and/or formation of this agreement to arbitrate made between you and AES.

Location; Language. You agree that arbitration shall take place exclusively in Arlington County, Virginia. However, where the disclosed claims or counterclaims do not exceed $25,000, the dispute may be resolved by the submission of documents only/desk arbitration (see the Rules for more details). Either party may, however, ask for a hearing, or the arbitrator may decide a hearing is necessary. Arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.

Confidentiality. The arbitration and information disclosed during arbitration may not be disclosed to any third party except as required by law. The parties will not make any comments or announcements to the public about the subject matter or outcome of any arbitration.

Changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate. If AES modifies this arbitration provision, you may reject that change by sending AES written notice within thirty (30) days of our posting of the change to the Site and you must immediately stop using the Site and Content.

The Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decisions and judgement will be final and binding on the parties, but will have no precedential effect. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to award damages outside of those set forth in these Terms.

Costs and Expenses. Each party shall pay their own expenses and fees, including their own attorneys’ fees, arising from arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims were improper or frivolous, in which case the arbitrator may require you to reimburse us for certain fees and expenses in accordance with the Rules.

Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, you and AES each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights.

Furthermore, in the event these Terms are held to be a consumer agreement, certain countries, jurisdictions or provinces (e.g. Quebec) may prohibit this agreement to arbitrate and/or the waiver of class actions, in which case the applicable portions of this clause shall be severed from these Terms and the remaining terms and conditions in these Terms will continue in full force and effect.

Copyright Infringement
We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and we ask you to do the same.  We strive to expeditiously remove infringing material from the Site if we become aware of it.  It is our policy to terminate repeat infringers' use of the Site to the extent technologically feasible.  If you are a resident of the United States, please see our Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") policy below for more information on submitting or responding to claims under the DMCA.

Investor Information
The Site contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES’ current expectations based on reasonable assumptions. Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate projections of future interest rates, commodity price and foreign currency pricing, continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity volume at our distribution companies and operational performance at our generation businesses consistent with historical levels, as well as the execution of PPAs, conversion of our backlog and growth investments at normalized investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Important factors that could affect actual results are discussed in AES’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including, but not limited to, the risks discussed under Item 1A: “Risk Factors” and Item 7: "Management’s Discussion & Analysis" in AES’ 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Readers are encouraged to read AES’ filings to learn more about the risk factors associated with AES’ business. AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Any Stockholder who desires a copy of the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2020, with the SEC may obtain a copy (excluding Exhibits) without charge by addressing a request to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, The AES Corporation, 4300 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203.

Third-Party Websites and Content
Third Party Websites. As a convenience to the visitors of our Site, AES may include some links to websites that are owned and operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”), not AES. AES has no control over the contents of those sites or resources, thus AES is not responsible nor liable for the privacy practices, content, or transactions of Third-Party Sites. Inclusion of a link to a Third-Party Site on AES’ website does not imply AES’ endorsement of that Third-Party Site or the third-party content, goods, and services. AES is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of, and does not warrant or endorse, any Third-Party Site or any programs, products, or services made available through those websites.

Third-Party Content. The Site contains third-party content for your convenience (“Third-Party Content”). The presence of Third-Party Content does not mean that AES endorses the Third-Party Content, has reviewed the Third-Party Content, or that there is any association between AES and any third party. You access Third-Party Content at your sole risk. For example, when you view market data provided by Ticker Technologies, such market data is not controlled by AES, and you use such data at your sole risk. AES has no responsibility for any Third-Party Content.

Nothing in these Terms grants you any rights to any Third-Party Content.

Social Media Pages

We may work with the third-party service providers of the Social Media Pages to block users who are being offensive, abusive, disruptive, or otherwise violating these Terms or any applicable laws.

If AES follows, likes, re-tweets, favorites, shares, re-posts, or does any other similar action to any user’s content on its Social Media Pages, that is not an endorsement of that third party or any product, service, or company they represent.
