If your policy, or the policy that you are authorized by the Named Insured to access through your username account as the authorized representative (&ldquo;Authorized Representative&rdquo;), is eligible for enrollment in Paperless, written communications delivered electronically in electronic format may include policy documents, billing invoices, return payment notices and debit withdrawal notices, auto policy ID Cards, Notices or disclosures<strong>. At this time, cancellation, nonrenewal, conditional renewal, renewal with altered terms and premium increase notices are NOT subject to Paperless electronic delivery.</strong> Only the policy Category for the eligible policy(ies) you have selected will be enrolled for this service. The policy Categories available for Paperless delivery are: Policy Details (Declarations), ID Cards and Billing Invoices or Billing Documents. Not all policies are eligible for this service and not all policy documents are being delivered electronically. In order to enroll in Paperless, you must create a username account with a valid email address.</p><p>Paperless refers to the services available through your username account for the policy(ies) that you are authorized by the Named Insured to access, that permit you to receive electronic notification of a policy document being delivered to your username account, which you can view, print, or download. By enrolling in Paperless, you, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative, consent to electronic delivery of notifications for new document availability in your username account and agree to be bound by these Paperless Terms of Use, in addition to the other Terms of Use for the Site. If you do not agree with any of these Terms of Use, you may not enroll in Paperless. ERIE is not required to deliver information electronically. ERIE may discontinue Paperless in whole or in part, or change the Terms of Use, at any time. Your continued participation in Paperless, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative of the Named Insured, will constitute your acceptance of any revisions to these Terms of Use. Please check these Terms of Use on the Site regularly. Upon enrolling in Paperless, you will receive a confirmation email from ERIE. You should contact ERIE Customer Care at 1-800-485-0811 if you do not receive this confirmation email within 5 business days. By enrolling in Paperless, you, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative of the Named Insured, agree to electronically receive eligible Paperless policy documents, ID cards, and/or billing invoices either (1) via email; or (2) by your accessing the Site through your username account, pursuant to an email notice that we send to you at the time a document becomes available. It is your responsibility to log in to your username account for the Site to view your Paperless documents. ERIE may continue to send paper copies of certain documents to you via United States Postal Services (USPS), if required by law or as otherwise necessary due to technical or process considerations. Electronic delivery is not currently available for all documents.</p><p>It is your responsibility as the Named Insured or Authorized Representative to maintain a valid, current email address and immediately notify ERIE of any change in your email address through your username account. Ensure that your email is active and capable of receiving new emails from ERIE. Your email account must have sufficient space for new emails and your email server and spam-blocking software must not block ERIE&rsquo;s emails. ERIE is not responsible for problems arising from emails sent to an inactive or out-of-date email address, or for email messages that are undeliverable because your email address was not capable of receiving email messages from ERIE, unless we are solely negligent for using an incorrect address. We will make an additional attempt to redeliver an email message that is returned to ERIE as undeliverable. If it is returned once again as undeliverable, we will presume that you have withdrawn your consent for Paperless delivery in that specific Paperless delivery Category. You will be unenrolled for Paperless for only the Paperless delivery Category that had an undeliverable email address. Going forward, your documents for that Category will be sent to your mailing address on file via the United States Postal Service (USPS). Your enrollment selection for remaining Paperless delivery Categories will remain unchanged. Your consent, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative, to enrollment in Paperless will remain in effect for each selected Paperless delivery Category and policy until termination or cancellation of the policy, or until you revoke your consent for the specific Paperless delivery Category. Paperless electronic delivery will remain in effect following any policy modification or renewal. There is no charge associated with enrolling or unenrolling in Paperless. You, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative, may unenroll from Paperless and withdraw your consent to transact business electronically by updating your preferences through your username account under Settings. (Please allow up to 24 hours to process your unenrollment.) The delivery selection of your billing invoices does not alter the payment due date or debit withdrawal date and may not take effect until the next billing cycle or policy period.</p><p>Email notifications will be sent to the email address on file with your username account as a Named Insured or an Authorized Representative to advise once your electronic documents are available to view in your username account. Documents will be made available via your username account in a PDF or HTML format, so you must have a valid email account, access to an Internet browser, appropriate document viewer such as Acrobat&reg; or similar software, and an active username account to access and view the documents. If you wish to print documents, you must also have access to a printer. Note that you may have the ability to access and view your documents on demand through your username account.</p><p>ERIE will not send you a paper copy of any document unless you request it, ERIE otherwise deems it appropriate, or ERIE is legally required to do so. You may obtain a paper copy of any document ERIE provides to you electronically by printing it yourself or by requesting that ERIE mail you a paper copy. To request a paper copy of a document, contact your ERIE Agent, or ERIE Customer Care at 1-800-485-0811.</p><p>All communications in either electronic or paper format from ERIE to you, as the Named Insured or as the Authorized Representative will be considered "in writing." You should print or download for your records a copy of all documents, these Paperless Terms of Use and any other document that is important to you.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that your consent to transact electronic business is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and your state's UETA law as applicable.</p><h3>Important State Specific Disclosures and Consent Language</h3><p>Specific disclosures and consent language may be required by certain states. Please read the disclosures or consent language below applicable to the state for which your policy is issued.</p><h4> Tennessee and Kentucky:</h4><p>The policyholder electing to allow for notices and communications to be sent to the electronic mail address provided by the policyholder should be aware that the insurer rightfully considers this election to be consent by the policyholder that all notices may be sent electronically, including notice of nonrenewal and notice of cancellation. Therefore the policyholder should be diligent in updating the electronic mail address provided to the insurer in the event that the address should change.</p><p>NOTE: <strong>At this time, cancellation, nonrenewal, conditional renewal, renewal with altered terms and premium increase notices are NOT subject to ERIE&rsquo;s Paperless electronic delivery.</strong></p><h3>Limitations of Damages</h3><p>IN NO EVENT WILL ERIE, OR ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR PROGRAMS OR OTHER DATA ON ANY INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM) THAT ARE RELATED TO THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, ANY ASPECT OF THE SITE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE CONTENT AND FUNCTIONS OF THE SITE OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE, EVEN IF ERIE IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><h3>Changes to These Terms of Use</h3><p>ERIE reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, add or remove all or any portion of these Terms of Use at any time.
