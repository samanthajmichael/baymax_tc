The notification must be in writing and contain the following information (DMCA, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3)):</p>

<p>- Physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;</p>

<p>- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</p>

<li><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</b>

<ol type="a">
<li><u>Arbitration Agreement</u></li>

<p>You and Church &amp; Dwight agree that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act , and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us, including disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration.</p>

<p>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and conducted under AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect at the time of the dispute. You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879. If you initiate an arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA's Procedures once you have notified us in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if we are the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to us, including the filing fee.</p>

<li><u>Class Action Waiver</u></li>

<p>There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims against us and may not preside over any kind of representative or class proceeding against Church &amp; Dwight. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST CHURCH &amp; DWIGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND STOP USING THE WEBSITE AND SERVICES.</p>

<li><u>Governing Law</u></li>

<p>Subject to the Arbitration Agreement in section 9(a) herein, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to any conflicts of law provisions. Any cause of action with respect to this Website, the Services, or these Terms must be filed in Mercer County, New Jersey within 1 year after the cause of action has accrued; unless such a filing is made in accordance with such rules, the cause shall be permanently barred.</p>
