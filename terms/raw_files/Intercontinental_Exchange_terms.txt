In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as &quot;may,&quot; &quot;might,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;plan,&quot; &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;predict,&quot; &quot;potential&quot; or &quot;continue,&quot; and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include, but are not limited to, projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business and industry, statements concerning ICE’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on ICE’s current expectations about future events. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause ICE’s results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: ICE’s ability to implement its strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk and U.S. and global competition, and other factors detailed in ICE’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive and forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact that these factors will have on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such projections in any report should not be regarded as a representation by ICE that the projections will prove to be correct. Neither ICE nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of any report to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations and we do not intend to do so.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="!mb-10"><div id="integration-id-fcd7624" class=""><div id=""></div><div class=""><div id="integration-id-824620d" class=""><h5 class="m-0 font-headings border-0 pb-0 mers:border-b-2 mers:border-solid mers:border-secondary mers:pb-2.5 print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 font-medium normal-case leading-none print:break-after-avoid text-lg imt:mb-4 imt:text-xs md:text-2xl md:imt:text-lg">Proprietary Rights</h5><hr class="border-0 border-black border-t border-solid mx-0 my-4"/><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">All right, title and interest in this Website, including all of the software and code comprising or used to operate this Website, including but not limited to the applicable updates and all of the text, content, all compilations of real time or other information, including all pricing and market data, any software programs, tools, applications and/or code available on or through this Website and accompanying links, photographs, images, video, audio and graphics contained on this Website, the selection and arrangement of the aforementioned and the “look and feel” of this Website, are owned, licensed or controlled by ICE, its applicable affiliate, its licensors or the relevant third party (“Third Party Provider”) credited as the owner or lawful provider of the content.

If you and ICE cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York, New York.

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The arbitrator may not preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, however, in the event that five or more claims in arbitration are initiated which assert the same or similar factual allegations, or raise the same or similar legal issues, we may request that the claims be consolidated for resolution consistent with Rule 6 of the Streamlined Rules, and you agree to consolidation of your claim with the claims of other claimants asserting the same or similar factual allegations, or whose claims raise the same or similar legal issues.

The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p><p class="print:orphans-3 print:widows-3 print:text-black mb-6 last:mb-0">You and ICE agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and ICE will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.

Such forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include, but are not limited to, projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business and industry, statements concerning ICE’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on ICE’s current expectations about future events. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause ICE’s results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: ICE’s ability to implement its strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk and U.S. and global competition, and other factors detailed in ICE’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive and forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact that these factors will have on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such projections in any report should not be regarded as a representation by ICE that the projections will prove to be correct. Neither ICE nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
