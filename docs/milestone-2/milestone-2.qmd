## Reflections

### Challenges

Using Modal and successfully hosting our local LLaMA 3 model has remained a persistent obstacle. Despite our efforts, we haven't been able to overcome the technical hurdles associated with this integration. This has led us to temporarily utilize OpenAI's API to ensure we could move forward with testing and development.

### RAG Process and its Impact on Application Performance

Our journey with RAG has been a learning experience, filled with both successes and challenges. While we've made significant progress, there are areas we're actively working on to improve the performance and user experience of our application.

* **The Shift to OpenAI API:** Initially, we encountered difficulties getting our local LLaMA 3 model running seamlessly on Modal. To ensure we could start testing and evaluating our RAG pipeline quickly, we decided to utilize OpenAI's API for this milestone. This strategic shift allowed us to focus on building a usable and functional application, enabling us to gather crucial feedback and refine our approach.
* **RAG Pipeline Progress:** Our RAG pipeline has demonstrated promising results, particularly with the 10 cleaned files we've incorporated so far. However, we recognize that scalability and robustness are key, and we're continuously working on enhancing the testing process to ensure its effectiveness.
* **Optimizing Answer Length:** A major hurdle we've encountered is finding the optimal balance in answer length. We've found that overly long answers can sometimes hinder performance, especially when evaluated against metrics like correctness, faithfulness, and contextual relevancy using deepeval. Conversely, overly short answers can also lead to failing these metrics. We're actively refining our approach to identify the "sweet spot" that maximizes accuracy and relevance while remaining concise and impactful.

### Looking Ahead

Our next milestone is to implement the RAG pipeline using Modal and LLaMA 3, which will require further exploration and optimization. We're confident that by leveraging the learnings from our current iteration, we can create a more efficient, robust, and user-friendly system.

To ensure the accuracy and robustness of our RAG pipeline, we plan to significantly improve our unit tests by incorporating a wider range of metrics, including ROUGE, BLEU, and hallucination scores from deepeval. This will enable us to more comprehensively assess the quality of generated answers, identify potential biases, and refine our model's performance in generating accurate and relevant responses.
